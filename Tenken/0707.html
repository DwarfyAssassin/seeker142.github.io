<h2 id="ch707">707: Mordred Battle Ends</h2>

<p>Waves of raging lava surrounded us. In addition, a bright red wall emitting tremendous heat was approaching from below us.</p>

<p>There was no escape. Fran would be swallowed up by the lava.</p>

<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>（Not yet!）</p>

<p>We can make it if we use teleportation. That's what I thought, but Fran still seems to think she can manage on her own.</p>

<p>「Phew……… Ryaaaaah!」</p>

<p>What Fran did was simple. She deployed a barrier to its full extent and plunged into the lava. She put up a slightly thicker barrier in front of herself, and all that's left was to run full speed ahead.</p>

<p>The faster she ran, the shorter the time she would be covered in lava.</p>

<p>With Fran now, it would not have been difficult, provided there was no interference from Mordred.</p>

<p>「Ugh!」</p>
<p>『A metal ball!』</p>

<p>Suddenly, Fran's path was diverted to the side by a violent impact.</p>

<p>Mordred had predicted Fran's path and launched a metal ball.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to find the metal ball using magic detection because they are covered with the same kind of magic power as the lava. Even if we tried to detect them physically, the lava was blocking our vision.</p>

<p>If she stops her footsteps in the lava, she will soon reach the limit of her barrier. If she tried to force her way through the lava, she would be attacked by the metal spheres.</p>

<p>Either way, Fran was at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>She had been dragged into Mordred's playing field completely. This is how a veteran player plays the game, I guess.</p>

<p>So, where do we go from here? If it were up to me, I'd go with teleportation or dimension shift.</p>

<p>Fran is trying to use dimensional storage, but it doesn't seem to be working. I guess she can't suck in the lava because Mordred has the control of the lava.</p>

<p>As I watched to see what she would do, Fran stepped forward again. She is on the same course as before, heading straight for Mordred.</p>

<p>Is she going to run straight at Mordred at the cost of taking damage?</p>

<p>As soon as Fran ran forward through the sea of lava toward the bottom again, the metal ball attacked her. Even I didn't notice it until just before it touched the barrier.</p>

<p>It was such a stealthy attack. However, Fran had succeeded in parrying the blow with the barrier.</p>

<p>She deformed the shape of the barrier slightly, which deflected the ball. I don't think she should have had enough time to deform the barrier as quickly as she did……</p>

<p>I thought it was a fluke, but Fran succeeded in preventing one attack after another.</p>

<p>The angle of the barrier was perfectly adjusted to deflect and sometimes repel the flying metal balls.</p>

<p>It was obvious that she could sense the movement of the metal balls.</p>

<p>But how? I have tried various ways, but the presence of the lava is blocking me, and I can't get it to work at all.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mordred is very good at hiding the presence of magic and the flow of magic power. He must have honed this skill by dealing with magical beasts that are unusually sensitive to the presence of magic.</p>

<p>I can't tell when he activated his magic, but before I knew it, the magic had already activated under our feet. It would not be easy even for me to keep on detecting the attacks of Mordred like this.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear how she's doing it, but I don't want to interrupt her right now. I'll ask later.</p>

<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>「Argh! Rising Impulse!」</p>

<p>After breaking through the wall of lava, we entered a small empty space surrounding Mordred. Fran immediately slashes at Mordred. Mordred, on the other hand, responded with martial arts.</p>

<p>He thrust his spear above his head and fired a shockwave into the air.</p>

<p>Mordred used this technique to kill Fran's momentum and then defended himself with a metal ball. Or that must have been his intention.</p>

<p>However, Fran used aerial movement to leaped down in the air and slash at Mordred while keeping her momentum.</p>

<p>The shockwave was blocked by the barrier at least minimally, and she twisted her body to make the spear miss her vital points. The left side of her abdomen was cut, but the wound was not fatal.</p>

<p>Then she used me to strike the metal balls blocking us in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Naturally, Mordred reacts quickly and I am entangled with five metal balls. From the outside, I look like a distorted metal baseball bat.</p>

<p>From Mordred's point of view, he succeeded in completely blocking Fran's weapon. However, his expression did not look good.</p>

<p>He must have realized that Fran had purposely hit the metal balls.</p>

<p>Yes, Fran did not avoid the metal balls, but intentionally attacked with me. As a result, I was pulled down so fast that she could not maintain her position after she landed on the ground and fell forward.</p>

<p>Mordred, on the other hand, was aiming to stop her by using a spear art, even though he didn't know Fran's intention.</p>

<p>「Quick Pierce!」</p>

<p>A quick pierce to the head of Fran. But this is exactly the moment Fran was aiming for.</p>

<p>「Taaaaah!」</p>
<p>「I've been lured!」</p>

<p>Fran thrusts me at Mordred. There were no metal balls attached to the blade.</p>

<p>Fran had used dimensional storage. She put me away for a split second, then took me out again. The metal spheres under Mordred's control cannot be stored, so only I am stored and then freed from the metal spheres.</p>

<p>Neither the metal balls, nor the spear, nor the needle armor will be able to stop Fran's sword in time.</p>

<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>「Gohu…… Gah!」</p>

<p>Mordred's thrust grazed Fran's left cheek, and at the same time, Fran's stab pierced through Mordred's stomach, and the black lightning burned his body from the inside. Mordred falls to the ground, smoke billowing from his body.</p>

<p>He's lost consciousness. Fran has won. It's a win, but……</p>

<p>『Fran! Use the dimensional storage!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>

<p>A huge amount of lava has come falling down all at once, having lost its master. If we don't do anything, Mordred will be caught with us in the middle.</p>

<p>The lava that was already out of Mordred's control can cleaned up via dimensional storage. The vast amount of lava all gets sucked into our storage.</p>

<p>『Whoa! Just when we thought the arena was covered with lava, now the lava suddenly disappears! What's more, the match has already been decided! What in the world happened inside! And, earth mages and healers, it's time to go to work!』</p>
