<h2 id="ch717">717: Beyond Heavenly Judgment</h2>

<p>「I'm just about warmed up, let's get this party going!」</p>

<p>Sibylla's words were no lie. The amount of magic flowing through her body increased at once, and red magic overflowed from her entire body.</p>

<p>The pressure we sense now was no less than that of the strongest opponents we've fought up until now.</p>

<p>As if to show that this tremendous magical power was no fluke, Sibylla's speed increased not just one stage, but several stages.</p>

<p>「Shaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Gu……!」</p>

<p>Sibylla may have become accustomed to Fran's movements, but Fran's hesitation also slowed down her movements slightly.</p>

<p>Fran, who should have had the advantage in speed, was beginning to be pushed back by Sibylla's onslaught. Our lack of vision for a successful attack is beginning to affect her evasion.</p>

<p>Even if she continues to evade the attacks, she will not be able to break out of this situation.</p>

<p>『Fran… let's go on the offensive.』</p>
<p>（……Okay.）</p>

<p>Sibylla stopped her movements when she saw Fran use aerial movement to jump away from her. She must have sensed that we were about to use our trump card.</p>

<p>「Ha-ha-ha! Suddenly your hesitation is gone! Come on! I'll wait as long as you want!」</p>

<p>She is laughing in this situation. But I'm going to wipe that smile off your face!</p>

<p>「Phew………」</p>

<p>If Sibylla is willing to wait, let's take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Fran is more focused than ever. She circulates her magic between us, as if to unify the both of us, and sharpens it all as if to put everything she has into a single blow.</p>

<p>It is a strange sensation, as if I am an extension of Fran's body. A sense of elation that my sword self will be utilized to its fullest potential. Even before I am swung, my body trembles with delight.</p>

<p>It may be similar to when Fran, in her Sword God Transformation state, wielded me.</p>

<p>「Hah……」</p>

<p>Sibylla only smiles like a wild beast and braces herself in front of Fran, who kneads an enormous amount of magic power while holding me overhead.</p>

<p>Sibylla was seriously going to take it without interfering.</p>

<p>Then Fran closed the gap at once.</p>

<p>「Phew………」</p>
<p>「…!」</p>

<p>Sibylla does not react. Whether she can't or won't, she just stares at Fran.</p>

<p>「Heavenly Judgment.」</p>

<p>Leaving all sound behind, a blade of divine speed swings down too silently, striking Sibylla's body…</p>

<p>「!」</p>
<p>『What!』</p>
<p>「That's amazing! But, it's still not enough!」</p>

<p>Don't be ridiculous! If that's not enough, then what CAN cut Sibylla?</p>

<p>No, it's not that I couldn't cut her at all. My blade sliced through Sibylla's shoulder about 10cm, making her bleed for the first time.</p>

<p>But it was a blow from Heavenly Judgment, which Fran, in her Brilliant Lightning Rush state, had fired with all her might. And that's all it did?</p>

<p>『That attack even had a slight divine attribute on it!』</p>
<p>（? Really?）</p>

<p>Fran herself didn't notice it.</p>

<p>However, I, who had acquired the divine energy manipulation skill, was able to sense it.</p>

<p>Considering that the Sword God Transformation is what is beyond Heavenly Judgment, it is not strange for it to apply a divine attribute.</p>

<p>I think that Fran has finally taken that step to the next level.</p>

<p>However, Sibylla looks calm. Moreover, the wounds that should have been inflicted by the divine attribute began to regenerate instantly.</p>

<p>This overwhelming defense and unbelievable regenerative power. That may be what most people tend to focus on, but there was something else that was not right. Even if we didn't cut all the way, it was a super high-speed blow, right? There must have been a considerable impact behind it.</p>

<p>The fact that it hit her without cutting all the way means that the force must have been transferred to Sibylla. And Sibylla did not seem to do anything to deflect the momentum, yet she did get knocked back at all.</p>

<p>I've seen this before. She looked just like Fran, when she had used physical nullification last year at the martial arts tournament.</p>

<p>『So it really is physical nullification?』</p>

<p>But the divine attribute should transcend ordinary skills. Even a skill that nullifies physical attacks can't protect against the divine attribute. Why was the cut so shallow? No, is it because of its divine attribute that we were able to cut her, however shallow, in the first place?</p>

<p>And if it is a resistance skill, I don't understand why all of our magic spells were blocked.</p>

<p>（Master… can you draw out the divine attribute?）</p>
<p>『……Let's try it.』</p>

<p>It seems that the divine attribute is the key. Using divine energy manipulation, I convert my own magical power into divine energy. It's not going to be easy, but I won't give up.</p>

<p>Remember the Sword God Transformation and Heavenly Judgment. I can do it.</p>

<p>Then I feel a sudden increase in my own presence, and a sense of power overflows me.</p>

<p>『Here it comes…… I can do it… not as good as the Sword God Transformation though.』</p>
<p>（Plenty.）</p>

<p>Fran moved again, not with the Heavenly Judgment, but with the Sheaths of Wind. However, it is a blow with as much magic power as the Heavenly Judgment.</p>

<p>Though not as powerful as the Heavenly Judgment, Sibylla's cheek was wounded. It seemed that the divine attribute could not be completely blocked by Sibylla.</p>

<p>Fran's continued the offensive. But not with her sword.</p>

<p>Fran's fist struck Sibylla's torso. And my string is wrapped around that fist.</p>

<p>「Goh!……」</p>
<p>『Eh?』</p>

<p>Sibylla had been damaged by a punch that was far less powerful than a slash. The wind was knocked out of her lungs and she clutched her chest with a bitter expression.</p>

<p>It seemed to have been discomfort from the damage of her internal organs rather than pain.</p>

<p>「I knew it. You're weaker to punches than swords?」</p>
<p>「Kuku…… You noticed.」</p>

<p>I see. It seems that she doesn't have a uniform defense against all attacks.</p>

<p>She seems to have an unbreakable defense against swords, but not so much against blows. That she took damage from Colbert could be because she was weak to blunt damage. Or, it could be that she is weak to force penetrating her body.</p>

<p>It's true that she is tough, but it is enough to know that she is not invincible.</p>

<p>Both slashes and blows are more or less effective if they are laced with the divine attribute.</p>

<p>『Then we'll just keep slashing and hitting with everything we've got!』</p>
<p>（Nn!）</p>
<p>『Leave it to me to maintain the divine attribute.』</p>
<p>（Please.）</p>

<p>Using the Sword God Transformation is a last resort. If we fail to beat her with the Sword God Transformation, which can't be used for an extended duration, we will instantly be at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>「Ha-ha-ha-ha! This is where the real battle begins!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
