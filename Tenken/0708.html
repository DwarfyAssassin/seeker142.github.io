<h2 id="ch708">708: Victory and Reflection</h2>

<p>Fran, who had won the match, was walking down the aisle to the special spectator seats.</p>

<p>She had used Brilliant Lightning Rush, and her magic and physical strength were exhausted. She must have taken a lot of damage too. I would like to let her rest at the inn if possible, but it is also important to gather information on the matches.</p>

<p>I will give her a good rest tomorrow, and let her be quiet while watching the matches today.</p>

<p>As Fran was walking silently, I asked her what had been bothering me about the Mordred match.</p>

<p>『Hey Fran, can I ask you something?』</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>『How did you detect Mordred's metal spheres in the lava? The magic was masked and it was hard to get a read on him, right?』</p>
<p>「Did you feel a tingle?」</p>
<p>『A tingle?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>I don't know what you're talking about…… You mean you you sensed something with your natural instincts? Or is there something else?</p>

<p>『Tingle, huh? Can you be a little more specific?』</p>
<p>「Nn… a little bit of the magic I used left a tingle on the sphere.」</p>
<p>『Oh, really?』</p>

<p>If Fran's magic made the ball tingle, it must be lightning magic.</p>

<p>It seems that when it blocked the lightning magic, the magic power remained in the metal ball. I guess you could say it was electrified.</p>

<p>Fran's sense sharpened by Brilliant Lightning Rush seems to have caught that slight lightning attribute. It may not be unrelated to the fact that Black Heaven Tigers have a high affinity for the lightning attribute.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can do something like that if I try hard enough.</p>

<p>『Even so, you would have won even if I didn't participate.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>Last year, when we fought against Colbert, a rank B adventurer of the same rank, I helped her out and we won by brute force after using physical attack negation.</p>

<p>This time, however, Fran won by herself.</p>

<p>However, Fran is looking somewhat unhappy.</p>

<p>『……Are you frustrated?』</p>
<p>「Nn……」</p>
<p>『Well, he's a veteran so of course he's taking the lead. That's one area that just can't be helped.』</p>
<p>「I know. But it's frustrating. Besides, I was a bit overconfident. I'll do better next time.」</p>

<p>Although she outplayed Mordred in the end, she had been at Mordred's mercy until that point.</p>

<p>He was not only skillful, but also anticipated Fran's personality to enjoy the battle.</p>

<p>In a sense, everything had been foreshadowing, and until the final Volcanic Gazer, the game was being played according to Mordred's plan.</p>

<p>Probably, Mordred had prepared several simulations in advance, and had prepared several plans for what he would do if Fran moved a certain way.</p>

<p>Even though Fran won, it was a disappointing match for her.</p>

<p>「He was great.」</p>
<p>『Yes, it was.』</p>

<p>Brilliant Lightning Rush, Sword God Form, dimensional magic, Swordking Arts. If we had went all in, there's a possible we could have won in the first few seconds of the match.</p>

<p>But all things considered that would just be brute force. If it were against a veteran player with the same level of power, it might not work. At least, it would not be an easy victory.</p>

<p>And I knew just such an opponent.</p>

<p>『Diaz is even worse.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>I can't come up with any counter measures for him. But it was a great experience for us to fight Mordred here. We must make the most of this victory in the future.</p>

<p>As we were walking along, we heard some commotion in front of us.</p>

<p>「I'm sorry, sir!」</p>
<p>「Damn! If you're going to apologize, don't start acting like a fool from the beginning!」</p>

<p>Someone is making a scene with the adventurers. At first glance, it looks like the adventurers are at fault, but the soldier who rushes to the scene is angry with the man who is on his knees.</p>

<p>Perhaps he is a recruiter from the Kingdom of Shallus. As the guild had told me, they were causing a ruckus in many places.</p>

<p>The guards were giving him an exasperated warning, but the Shallus Kingdom people did not show any remorse. In any case, their apologies were all lies. They are probably going to keep trying to recruit us.</p>

<p>『Fran, let's get out of here before we get caught in the middle of this.』</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>

<p>I wonder what the Shallus Kingdom people are really after. They're gonna make it really hard for the guards. I wonder if they will be banned from the venue soon.</p>

<p>Back at the spectator seats, the game has not started yet. Since Mordred has turned the whole playing field into lava, and since Fran has stowed away all of it away.</p>

<p>But it was almost ready. Several magicians who could use earth magic proceeded to clear the ground and set up the stage. The workmanship was quite good.</p>

<p>And so the second match began……</p>

<p>『It's decided! The mercenary Biscot has pulled off a brilliant coup de grace to win the match!』</p>
<p>「It's over!」</p>

<p>Biscot had finished him off in seconds. I couldn't check out any of his moves or tactics. Well, complaining won't help.</p>

<p>But more importantly, the next match is coming up. After a few okayish games between unknown fighters, we have a must-see game coming up.</p>

<p>Fran knows this. She puts away her food and snacks and takes her hands off Urushi, who has was getting smothered. She straightens her back and stares quietly into the arena.</p>

<p>After all, the next match is between Sibylla and Colbert.</p>

<p>『Here comes the rank B adventurer, Colbert the Iron Claw! He is said to have left the Dimitris school, so what kind of fight will he show us? The first round was almost an instant kill, but what about the next round?』</p>

<p>As expected, the commentator would not use the negative word "expulsion". Still, I would like to see how Colbert will fight now that no longer has the Dimitris style.</p>

<p>『Against him is the red-haired mercenary Sibylla! Like Colbert, Sibylla showed us an impressive first-round KO in a blink of an eye! Let's see how close she can get to Colbert!』</p>

<p>Listening to the commentary and the reaction of the audience, it was clear that Sibylla was being treated as a lower rank. This is how unknown mercenaries are treated, I guess.</p>

<p>However, the two fighters themselves seem to have a different view. Sibylla lets out a chuckle of amusement, while Colbert glares at Sibylla with a stern expression.</p>

<p>If you are at Colbert's level, you know what Sibylla is capable of. The amount of magic he is weaving in his body is a sign of utmost vigilance.</p>

<p>「Colbert is starting off at full power?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, seems so.』</p>
<p>「Sibylla is just like me.」</p>

<p>You mean she's going to wait and see at the start. Let's see what happens.</p>

<p>『Let the games begin!』</p>
