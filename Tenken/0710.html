<h2 id="ch710">710: Colbert and Hilt</h2>

<p>「Colbert, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Oh, Fran……」</p>

<p>When we entered the infirmary, we found Colbert lying on the bed with a bandage wrapped around his head. When Fran called out to him, he was able to respond normally.</p>

<p>I wondered what would happen to him after the terrible head-butt, but it seems that he was saved by a healing spell.</p>

<p>However, his skull was caved in and he suffered fractures from the fall. In addition, the recoil from special technique he delivered to Sibylla damaged every muscle in his body, and for a time he appeared to be in danger.</p>

<p>He is sullen and drooping.</p>

<p>「I've lost.」</p>
<p>「Nn, I saw that.」</p>
<p>「Sigh. I know it's my fault that my best moves didn't work. I didn't think it could take her down, but I thought I could at least knock her out of the ring……」</p>
<p>「That was a great thrust.」</p>
<p>「Yeah? It's my own special technique that I developed after I was expelled from the Dimitris school, but……」</p>
<p>「But?」</p>
<p>「It's not complete.」</p>

<p>Dimitris school is a school that utilizes magical discharge. It has a wide variety of uses, including far-reaching attacks by shooting ki and strengthening the body with ki.</p>

<p>However, because of the sealing of the Dimitris style, Colbert's ability to use ki, which he had taken for granted, has been greatly reduced.</p>

<p>However, he still had some of the skills he had acquired, such as 'magic release', and he wondered if he could somehow use them in a different way.</p>

<p>「During a request, I fought with a magical beast that moved at high speeds by releasing magical power. You know how their movements are hard to detect, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>Basically, they release magic power behind them, accelerate, and rush forward. It's hard to predict how it moves by looking at their muscles and body movements.</p>

<p>「That's how I came up with the idea. I thought that if I could use the release of magic power, I could eliminate the wind up time of my attack.」</p>
<p>「That's what you were doing?」</p>
<p>「Yes. But it takes too much time to build up the power before. In a match like this, you can't apply it unless your opponent waits for you to attack. It will take a long time before I can use it in a real fight. Besides, it's not that powerful……」</p>
<p>「Sibylla got blasted away.」</p>
<p>「Even so, it's nothing more than a fast punch. I'm thinking that if you put magic into the attack itself, it'll make it perfect.」</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>

<p>A strike coming out of a neutral stance with extreme speed. And the cherry on top will be a magic release to cause internal organ destruction. This must be Colbert's ideal form.</p>

<p>「Then… Even Fran would take damage from that too, right?」</p>

<p>Colbert was thinking of this as a countermeasure to the physical nullification we were using last year.</p>

<p>「Dimitris style specializes in ki manipulation. It is a tremendous advantage to be able to use martial arts and techniques at a distance…… But Fran's ability nullifies not only fists, but also ki. Because of that, all the Dimitris style techniques were useless. I'm sure the young lady and the Master can do something about that though.」</p>

<p>Ki and magic are almost the same, but there are some subtle differences. The magic inside the body is ki. Outside the body it is called mana.</p>

<p>If you ask what the difference is, Fran and I don't really know…… But Dimitris style seems to clarify the difference and places a lot of emphasis on releasing ki out of the body.</p>

<p>By releasing ki at a long distance, it seems to be possible to use fist techniques that could normally only be used in close contact. I wonder if it's like attacking by manipulating a fist made of ki?</p>

<p>However, our physical nullification will also repel the ki. Otherwise, there is no explanation for the fact that we were able to completely nullify Colbert's various attacks using ki last year.</p>

<p>「That's why I was going to hit her with magic power instead of ki……」</p>

<p>As Colbert said, if magic is released into the body at such a distance, even physical nullification would not work. However, as the word "unfinished" implies, it seems that Colbert has not mastered it yet. He seems to have used up all of his magic power by propelling himself.</p>

<p>「Well, I'll show you the finished product one of these days.」</p>
<p>「I look forward to it.」</p>
<p>「Yeah…」</p>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p>Colbert smiled and nodded. Then the door to the infirmary opens with a force that threatens to send him flying.</p>

<p>「Colbert!」</p>
<p>「Whoa! M-Miss Hilt?」</p>

<p>A scary-looking Hilt jumps in. She looks around the infirmary with a piercing gaze that is almost as sharp as a gunshot.</p>

<p>「Hmm, looks like you're okay.」</p>

<p>I thought she was angry with Colbert for the defeat, but she was just in a panic. After seeing Fran conversing with Colbert, she was clearly breathing a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>「You are Fran, the Black Thunder Princess…… Why are you here?」</p>
<p>「To see him.」</p>
<p>「I see. I appreciate it.」</p>
<p>「Why would Hilt thank me?」</p>
<p>「Eh? H-He's a former member of our school! S-So even though it was a bit of a pain, I still need to check his injuries!」</p>
<p>「Hmmm…」</p>

<p>Hilt is looking very nervous. Her face is bright red and it's all too obvious.</p>

<p>But Colbert seems completely oblivious to Hilt's feelings.</p>

<p>「Sorry to bother you, miss.」</p>
<p>「Oh…… O-Of course! Jeez! How can you be defeated by such a no name mercenary! That proves you've been slacking on your training!」</p>
<p>「Haha. That's harsh.」</p>
<p>「W-Well, I can train you again, I suppose?」</p>

<p>Isn't this a subtle way of saying that she wants Dimitris to come back? But Colbert, it seems, was one of those dense protagonist types.</p>

<p>「I've been expelled. I can't go back to the Dimitris school.」</p>
<p>「…!」</p>

<p>Hilt seems annoyed. She is frustrated with Colbert for not reading her intentions, and with herself for not being honest.</p>

<p>This is so obvious that it's impressive he doesn't seem to notice it. Well, it's not easy to notice some things because of one's own bias, even if people around you are telling you otherwise. I remember screwing up a few times in some video games due to making bad assumptions.</p>

<p>Maybe in Colbert's mind, Hilt is nothing more than the heiress to the school, and one who is very strict to him. 'It is impossible for her to fall in love with me', or so he thinks.</p>

<p>「That's enough! Fran, I'm going to win!」</p>

<p>With these words, Hilt stormed off. The look she gave Fran at the end was full of hostility, since she was the reason for Colbert's expulsion and now she was the one who had to be defeated in order to make her love bear fruit. If they were to fight now, she would be even more fired up than before.</p>

<p>「Uhh, I'm sorry about the lady.」</p>

<p>We can't lose either, but we'll be rooting for you behind the scenes.</p>
