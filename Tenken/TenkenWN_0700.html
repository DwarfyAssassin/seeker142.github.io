<h2 id="ch704">704 Strong Opponents</h2>

<p> Today is the second day of the first round. The C and D blocks are having their matches.</p>

<p>「Hilt is out.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>

<p> We're sitting in our special seats again today, observing them.</p>

<p> Fran is sitting in front of Urushi, hugging him from behind and resting her chin on his head, enjoying the fluffy feeling of his fur.</p>

<p>『Now, what kind of match are you going to show me?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p> I appraise Hilt, who has appeared in the arena. She is strong as expected.</p>


<p>Name: Hiltoria Age: 23 years old</p>
<p>Race: Human</p>
<p>Occupation: Magic Pugilist</p>
<p>Status Level: 61/99</p>
<p>HP: 682 MP: 582 STR: 410 VIT: 262 AGI: 589 INT: 197 MAG: 366 DEX: 314</p>
<p>Skills</p>
<p>Foot Sense: Lv 4, Intimidation: Lv 6, Super Strength: Lv 6, Brawling Arts: Lv 3, Brawling Mastery: Lv 3, Crisis Sense: Lv 5, Holy Fist Arts: Lv 4, Holy Fist Mastery: Lv 6, Fist Arts: Lv Max, Fist Mastery: Lv Max, Hard Spirit: Lv 8, Hard Power: Lv Max, Instruction: Lv 6, Blink: Lv Max, Blink Step: Lv 3, Status Resistance Lv 5, Mental Resistance: Lv 5, Provocation: Lv 4, Throwing: Lv 4, Dimitris Style Martial Arts: Lv Max, Dimitris Style Mastery: Lv Max, Physical Barrier: Lv 6, Magic Resistance: Lv 6, Magic Perception: Lv 5, Magic Release: Lv 8, Drowsiness Resistance: Lv 5, Orc Killer, Kobold Killer, Gastronomy, Split Thinking, Energy Control</p>
<p>Unique Skills</p>
<p>Energy Outburst, Food Storage</p>
<p>Unique Skills</p>
<p>Magic Cloak Fist</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>Orc Killer, Kobold Killer, Giant Slayer, Heir to the Dimitris School, Bludger, Destroyer of Monsters, Rank A Adventurer</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>Spiral Piercing Knuckles, Tenma Silk Robe, Tenma Silk Garments, Water Dragonbone Wargreaves, Bracelet of Magic Control, Pendant of Regeneration</p>


<p> Her status is strong, but her skills are also great. Since she has max level in the Dimitris Style, she should be able to the use the same moves as Dimitris himself. I'm sure she should be able to use whatever secret arts the style has.</p>

<p> It would be like a higher level version of the Colbert we fought last year in the unsealed state.</p>

<p>『It would be nice to see a few Dimitris-style moves.』</p>
<p>「……No way.」</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>《The probability that the individual name Hiltoria uses Dimitris style martial arts, 2%.》</p>

<p> Not only Fran and Urushi, but even Announce-san! Well, I agree with you.</p>

<p> Hilt's opponent is a large adventurer with an axe. His face is stern and powerful. Walking through town, everyone would give way to him.</p>

<p> However, he is not very strong. Or rather, pretty weak. Their strength is much lower than those of the three Scarlet Maidens.</p>

<p> Since the preliminary matches are completely random, it is possible that a person with a weak ability may be selected for the main tournament if he or she wins a block full of weak players.</p>

<p> The match ended as expected. Hilt's jab, which was thrown as a feint, easily settled the match.</p>

<p> Unable to even react to Hilt's attack, the axeman collapsed in a heap after taking a jab to the jaw. We saw not even a glimpse of Hilt's ability.</p>

<p>『W-well, I'm sure they'll be a better opponent next time, so we'll see what happens then.』</p>
<p>「Nn……」</p>

<p> We continued to watch. I saw a friend of ours at the next match.</p>

<p>「Ladur.」</p>

<p> Fran actually remembered his name, which is a rare occurance. He is an old wizard of Ulmutt, with whom Fran had tea once. He is ranked C, but is as good as B. He was once in a party with Aurel apparently.</p>

<p> I couldn't watch his match last year, but I believe he was defeated by Cruz, who was supposed to be a lower ranked player. He was probably disoriented by his speed and was hit by a big move first.</p>

<p> He was a former court magician, so even though his level of magic was high, his physical status was quite low due to his old age.</p>

<p> How about this year?</p>

<p> I was a little worried while watching the match, but old Ladur was very strong. He said that he could use the 3 attributes of continental, storm, and ocean, and he used them exquisitely.</p>

<p> He did not use powerful magic, but rather a combination of simple spells.</p>

<p> He uses continental magic to break his opponent's foothold, flashy ocean magic to draw his attention, and invisible storm magic to quietly attack.</p>

<p> The enemy shieldman sank helplessly in the face of the variety of magic released without chanting.</p>

<p>『He might not be good with guys like Cruz that focus on speed and aim for big reckless damage, but he is pretty strong against a slow opponent.』</p>
<p>「Ladur is amazing!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>

<p> Fran's eyes were shining. He is not a flashy fighter, but he is a skilled fighter. I guess he is a similar type of player to Mordred, except this one specializes in sorcery.</p>

<p> In the final D block, there were quite a few players whom I know.</p>

<p> First up was Elza. His presence was as strong as ever, and his figure carrying a huge mace was so powerful that a child would have nightmares about it.</p>

<p> He was smiling as he took his opponent's attacks and easily won the match with a few attacks.</p>

<p> Next on stage was Charlotte. She is a girl who specializes in a rather tricky style, fighting with an iron ring in her hand while dancing.</p>

<p> She used the ring to capture her opponent's spear and snatch it away from him, winning the match without hesitation.</p>

<p> Both of them were strong, but the impact of the next person was no less impressive. The mantis-headed half-insectkin Nighthardt stood out that much.</p>

<p> Although he was barehanded, he had smashed and destroyed a steel sword. There were screams when he fought back against the sword with his bare hands, but the next moment there were loud cheers.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Name: Nighthardt Age: 57 years old</p>
<p>Race: Half-Insectkin - Mantis</p>
<p>Occupation: Twin Striker</p>
<p>Status Level: 66/99</p>
<p>HP: 897 MP: 214 STR: 588 VIT: 317 AGI: 612 INT: 138 MAG: 167 DEX: 433</p>
<p>Skills</p>
<p>Bad Eating: Lv 3, Feet Sense: Lv 4, Assassination: Lv 4, Covert: Lv 4, Singing: Lv 3, Observation: Lv 4, Crisis Perception: Lv 8, Archery Arts: Lv 4, Archery Mastery: Lv 6, Critical Detection: Lv 4, Courtly Etiquette: Lv 2, Calculation: Lv 5, Perception: Lv 6, Presence Blocking: Lv 5, Sword Arts: Lv 5, Sword Mastery: Lv 5, Holy Fist Arts: Lv 3, Holy Fist Mastery: Lv 3, Fist Arts: Lv Max, Fist Mastery: Lv Max, Hard Spirit: Lv 4, Negotiation: Lv Max, Hard Power: Lv 3, Command: Lv 7, Instruction: Lv 4, Blink: Lv Max, Blink Walk: Lv 8, Silence Action: Lv 6, Status Resistance: Lv 7, Mental Resistance: Lv 3, Twin Sword Arts: Lv Max, Farseeing: Lv 4, Fatigue Recovery: Lv 6, Magic Resistance: Lv 2, Magic Sense: Lv 3, Night Vision, Strengthen Legs, Leg Boost, Control Energy, Null Pain, Fortitude, Increase Agility</p>

<p> They are quite strong. Also, he was much older than the others. I thought he was in his twenties because he sounded like a handsome voice actor. I guess he has been fighting on the battlefield for many years, and that's why he is so strong.</p>

<p> He has some skills that we have not seen yet, and I am looking forward to seeing him in a real fight.</p>

<p> Felmus, the last one on the list, will bring out the best in Nighthardt. He is a former rank A adventurer who fought with us last year in the third place match.</p>

<p> His ever-changing strategy using threads really made us suffer. Even now, he uses strings to block his opponent's movements and his fists to settle the match. To the spectators, Felmus' opponents seem to have suddenly stopped moving for no reason.</p>

<p> Last time we managed to win the fight by overpowering him with big moves, but I am not sure if we will win the next time we fight.</p>

<p> Even Fran and Urushi and I have become much stronger since then. No, in the limited space of the arena, we would have a good chance to win.</p>

<p> But if it ever comes to a death battle in an area like a forest, I am honestly not so sure.</p>

<p>『It doesn't look like it will be easy to win again this year……』</p>
<p>「Nn! Bring it on!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『First, we have to beat Mordred!』</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「Arf-」</p>


<p>=====</p>

<p>My cold has gotten worse.</p>
<p>Sorry about that. The next update will be on the 12th.</p>


<h2 id="ch705">705 Start of Mordred Battle</h2>
<p>『Well, here we are! The second round of the tournament! A hot card is ready from the first match! The first to appear was the rank B adventurer, Mordred! He is a seasoned fighter who is skilled in the use of spears and molten magic!』</p>

<p> Fran went up on the stage to the cheers of the crowd as usual.</p>

<p>（Master. I'll start by myself.）</p>
<p>『Yeah, I know… I won't touch him until Fran asks me to or until we're about to lose. Urushi, you okay with that?』</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>

<p> The tournament is a test for Fran. Just like last year, I'm going to stay out of it until the last minute.</p>

<p>『Against him is the strongest 13 year old who won the first round in a blink of an eye! What kind of fight will she show in the next match? You can't take your eyes off her! Here comes Fran, the hero of the Black Cats!』</p>

<p> Fran and Mordred face each other in the center, smiling confidently.</p>

<p>「It's been a long time.」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I know it hasn't been that long, but you've gotten a lot stronger.」</p>
<p>「You too.」</p>

<p> Fran was right. Mordred had become much stronger. It is not so much that he has acquired new powers, but rather that his overall level has improved.</p>


<p>Name: Mordred Age: 43</p>

<p>「Well yeah, I can't let myself stay defeated by someone younger than me. I took a vacation for the first time in a long while and went to a monster den.」</p>
<p>「Monster den? Where did you go?」</p>

<p> Mordred was trying to play it cool, but Fran's eyes lit up at the mention of the "monster den".</p>

<p> Mordred gives a bitter smile at Fran's sudden aggressiveness before the fight.</p>

<p>「Well, I'll let you know if you can beat me.」</p>
<p>「Nn! Got it!」</p>

<p> Fran nods and awakens. This is one opponent she won't beat in her base form.</p>

<p>「I'll win.」</p>
<p>「You look excited.」</p>
<p>『They're both rank B! Will the cunning of the veteran prevail? Will the young and energetic win? It's a match to watch!』</p>

<p> And so the match began.</p>

<p> Both fighters were quiet at the start.</p>

<p> Fran started to use footwork to move around the stage while holding me at the ready, while Mordred stood firm and watched Fran's moves.</p>

<p> Fran is going to look for an opening and jump in at once. But it was Mordred who made the first move.</p>

<p>「If you aren't coming, I'll go first!」</p>

<p> He had read just before Fran was about to make a hasty move, and came forward at the perfect moment to catch Fran off guard.</p>

<p>「Sh!」</p>

<p> Mordred cleaves the spear horizontally while making a light feint using his eyes.</p>

<p> It was a sharp blow, but Fran was not fooled by such a feint. She handled it calmly.</p>

<p> She used me to catch Mordred's horizontal cleave and used the momentum to get behind him. Or at least that was what Fran was attempting, but…</p>

<p>「What?」</p>
<p>『Whoa!』</p>

<p> Mordred's spear bent with a jerk. As an adamantite alloy spear, it's impossible for such a light blow to even cause a scratch.</p>

<p>『Molten magic!』</p>
<p>「!」</p>

<p> He didn't seem to be chanting, but he must have activated it earlier.</p>

<p> The tip of the spear bent at the point where it made contact with me, aiming for Fran's head. Fran quickly ducked and dodged, but Mordred had already moved on to his next action.</p>

<p>「Hmph!」</p>
<p>「Mwah!」</p>

<p> As soon as the spear, which was wrapped around me like a string, returned to its original stiffness, he pulled me to him with all his might. Not only did he pull me with force, but he also gave the spear a slight twist, so that Fran's position would be slightly disrupted.</p>

<p> At the same time, Mordred's armor transformed into a hedgehog-like appearance.</p>

<p> If Fran tries to hold on to me, the needles in his armor will skewer her, and if she lets go of me, she will lose her weapon. Either way, Mordred would have the advantage.</p>

<p> This is what he has been trying to do from the beginning. He seemed to have been preparing multiple molten spells while pretending to be wary of us.</p>

<p> He is very skillful and had completely taken us by surprise.</p>

<p> However, Fran's ability to respond was not to be outdone.</p>

<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>「Whoa?」</p>

<p> Unexpectedly, Fran had hit Mordred with her free left hand. And she hit Mordred in the torso through the needles.</p>

<p> He might have expected to be attacked in the face, but he certainly did not expect Fran to hit him with her bare hands in such a reckless place.</p>

<p> Fran's fist is pierced by multiple needles, and a large amount of blood spurts out. However, Fran did not flinch at all and the fist went all the way through.</p>

<p> Mordred grunts and backs up a few meters. He must have sensed that he was going to be severely damaged if he stayed where he was, so he flew away.</p>

<p> He had not let go of his spear, but he was off his balance. Then Fran came in. It was a change of attack and defense.</p>

<p> Fran shakes off her left fist, which is still covered with blood, with a gesture as if stroking in the air. A large amount of blood splattered onto Mordred's face.</p>

<p> She used the blood to blind Mordred. Mordred calmly brushes it off with his cloak and backs away further.</p>

<p> Fran, perhaps not expecting him to be unfazed, stops chasing and slows down.</p>

<p> The distance is about the same as when we started.</p>

<p>「You're being reckless.」</p>
<p>「Yeah? But you weren't surprised at all.」</p>
<p>「Sometimes guys use blood as a weapon.」</p>

<p> Fran's idea of a surprise attack was not so unusual for Mordred.</p>

<p>「But like I thought, I'm at a disadvantage fighting face to face. I'll give it my all rather than conserving for the finals.」</p>
<p>「No! I won't let you!」</p>

<p> Mordred pulls something out of the bag at his waist. It's a familiar potion. It must be Mordred's trump card, which he used when we were together on a previous mission. A molten magic super-enhancement potion.</p>

<p> At this tournament, recovery potions are forbidden, but magic potions are not. I didn't quite understand what the difference was, but I heard that only the various types of recovery potions are forbidden in this tournament.</p>

<p> That is to say, enhancement drugs and poisons are allowed. This may be because many contestants are good at using them.</p>

<p> This tournament is not a honorable practice battle to decide who is the strongest. This is a competition for adventurers to show who comes out on top with no holds barred.</p>

<p> Fran tries to stop him with magic but it gets blocked just in front of Mordred. It was the effect of the warding stone. This is an item to create a disposable barrier, but he must have brought it for this occasion.</p>

<p> The well-prepared Mordred quickly drinks the potion. Immediately afterwards, I could tell that Mordred's magic power increased several times.</p>



<h2 id="ch706">706 Match Mastery</h2>
<p>「This is the new trump card I just developed!」</p>

<p> Mordred turns the bag of items removed from his waist upside down and shakes it gently up and down. Softball-sized metal balls fell out of the bag. A total of ten metal balls rolled out with a thud.</p>

<p> According to the results of my appraisal, they were called magicontrol alloy balls.</p>

<p> Mordred holds up his spear as he lightly rolls the metal balls under his feet.</p>

<p>「Spellshroud.」</p>

<p> Mordred muttered the name of his unique skill, and a reddish-black colored light rose from his whole body. It was molten magic.</p>

<p> Is this a full-body version of the Elemental Sword? Or does it have other abilities? As I wondered, I soon found out what it was capable of.</p>

<p>「Vulcanus Order!」</p>
<p>「!」</p>

<p> Before Fran's astonished eyes, the magic was activated. I knew this trick before. He had manipulated a huge anchor to bind kraken and water dragons. It is a high-level molten sorcery that allows one to manipulate metal within range at will.</p>

<p> It used to require a long chant. He's doing all that with just the name of the spell? The results of the pre-match appraisal showed that he did not possess any chant cancel or chantless casting skills.</p>

<p> Was it the effect of spellshroud?</p>

<p> Metal balls start to dance wildly in front of us. He may not be serious yet, but they are quite fast. Even in this state, if they hit us, they will probably break our bones.</p>

<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>「I'm fully prepared for the lightning magic!」</p>

<p> Before Fran is attacked, she releases a lightning spell.</p>

<p> In response, five metal balls protect Mordred like a shield. Then, Fran's thunder spell was bounced off and disappeared as if blocked by an invisible wall.</p>

<p> It seems that the magical power swirling around the metal ball acted as a barrier.</p>

<p>「Get crushed!」</p>
<p>「Not happening.」</p>

<p> Fran was forced on the defensive. Mordred moved his hand lightly, and the metal spheres attacked Fran at once.</p>

<p> Some of them were straight, some of them were arcing, and all of them were moving in different ways. Yet, they were able to drive Fran into a corner with precision.</p>

<p> He seems to have perfect control over the 10 metal balls.</p>

<p> Fran quickly knocked away the metal spheres, but even that was within Mordred's prediction. As soon as they hit me, the metal spheres deformed. I didn't feel a clean cut, it was if I had hit been hit with gelatin.</p>

<p> It is the same as the spear from before. The ball of metal is still entangled in my blade and won't come off. Fran can handle the extra weight, but it still prevents that part of the blade from cutting.</p>

<p> And that wasn't the only problem.</p>

<p>「What?」</p>

<p> Fran shouts in surprise when I suddenly make a move of my own.</p>

<p>『It wasn't me!』</p>

<p> Yes, it wasn't me. The metal wrapped around the blade was pulled in an unexpected direction by Mordred's manipulation.</p>

<p> This causes the metal ball to collide with my sword blade again, adding more weight to it.</p>

<p> Moreover, I felt a tremendous sense of discomfort. It was as if I was being forced to use the morphic transformation against my will. Perhaps Mordred's molten magic was working on me through the metal ball.</p>

<p> It seems that he can't manipulate me directly, but my concentration is being disturbed enough. I'll have to be careful from now on when dealing with molten magic wizards.</p>

<p> Fran is managing to force me under her control, even though I was not moving as she wanted me to. She is able to keep dodging but her escape route is gradually diminishing.</p>

<p> While evading, she was pulled to the other side and was lightly hit several times. Although they were still only grazes, they must have judged that it was dangerous to continue.</p>

<p> Fran moved forward, lowering herself.</p>

<p> She avoided the metal ball that tried to block his way with minimal movement while putting up a barrier. Just when it seemed that she was going to break through the encirclement of the metal balls…</p>

<p>「Gagh!」</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>

<p> Fran suddenly loses her position and almost falls. Her right leg sank into the ground as if it was buried.</p>

<p> She quickly put her hand on it and twisted her body to prevent herself from falling, but the condition of her right leg was quite bad.</p>

<p> It was burned and turned to ash in some places. It seemed that the lava had been made under the ground, and had been calculated to drop someone's foot into the lava when they stepped on it.</p>

<p> This was only possible because Fran covered her entire body with magic power, but if she had been a weaker magical beast or human, her feet would have been burned off and gone.</p>

<p>「Ugh!」</p>

<p> I quickly heal her with recovery magic, but in the meantime, Mordred moves on to his next action.</p>

<p>「Magma Field!」</p>

<p> Mordred puts his hands on the stage and pours magic power into the stage. The ground around Mordred starts to heat up red-hot at once.</p>

<p> The ground started to heat up red hot all at once with Mordred at the center. The tremendous heat was so intense that Fran was forced to flee to the sky in a hurry.</p>

<p> The range of the heat increased rapidly, and all the ground in the arena was heated to a bright red. The stone stage was melting into mush, and the inside of the arena was a complete sea of lava.</p>

<p> Mordred was standing on the lava with a cool face due to the effect of lava magic.</p>

<p>「Lightning bolt!」</p>
<p>「Block it!」</p>
<p>「Mwah!」</p>

<p> Fran's magic is still blocked by the metal ball. The superiority of the offensive side of Mordred's magic had been obvious, but the defensive power of the metal sphere was also troublesome.</p>

<p> The metal spheres are still orbiting around Mordred. It would take a lot of offensive power to break it.</p>

<p> Mordred looks up at Fran. Was he trying to force Fran into the air to take away her mobility? If so, that's a bit naive.</p>

<p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush!」</p>

<p> Fran has used her trump card.</p>

<p> With the aerial movement and Brilliant Lightning Rush, she can fight at the same speed as on the ground. No, she can even move faster than on the ground.</p>

<p> Fran is moving around in the air of the arena with me in position to counter Mordred's moves. As soon as she sees an opening, she's ready to dive in at the blink of an eye.</p>

<p> But even this was within Mordred's grasp.</p>

<p>「I knew that your speed was beyond my control.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「That's why I'm going to hit you with everything I've got while you're waiting to see what happens!」</p>

<p> It's impossible for him to hit a serious Fran with a normal attack. In that case, hit everything.</p>

<p>The magma field was not meant to drive Fran into the air, but as preparation for this attack.</p>

<p>「Volcanic--」</p>

<p> Mordred's hands, which had been lowered in a lazy motion, are lifted lightly, and only his wrists rotate with a jerk. If you are a tokusatsu enthusiast, you will understand if I tell you that it is the pose of Sh*n-Godzilla.</p>

<p> As if in response to his palms facing the sky, the magma around him begins to swell.</p>

<p>「--Geyser!」</p>

<p> And then the lava covering the ground of the arena explodes, filling inside of the barrier with lava.</p>



<h2 id="ch707">707 Mordred Battle Finished</h2>

<p> Waves of raging lava surrounded us. In addition, a bright red wall emitting tremendous heat was approaching from below us.</p>

<p> There was no escape. Fran would be swallowed up by the lava.</p>

<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>（Not yet!）</p>

<p> We can make it if we use teleportation. That's what I thought, but Fran still seems to think she can manage on her own.</p>

<p>「Phew……… Ryaaaaah!」</p>

<p> What Fran did was simple. She deployed a barrier to its full extent and plunged into the lava. She put up a slightly thicker barrier in front of herself, and all that's left was to run full speed ahead.</p>

<p> The faster she ran, the shorter the time she would be covered in lava.</p>

<p> With Fran now, it would not have been difficult, provided there was no interference from Mordred.</p>

<p>「Ugh!」</p>
<p>『A metal ball!』</p>

<p> Suddenly, Fran's path was diverted to the side by a violent impact.</p>

<p> Mordred had predicted Fran's path and launched a metal ball.</p>

<p> It is very difficult to find the metal ball using magic detection because they are covered with the same kind of magic power as the lava. Even if we tried to detect them physically, the lava was blocking our vision.</p>

<p> If she stops her footsteps in the lava, she will soon reach the limit of her barrier. If she tried to force her way through the lava, she would be attacked by the metal spheres.</p>

<p> Either way, Fran was at a disadvantage.</p>

<p> She had been dragged into Mordred's playing field completely. This is how a veteran player plays the game, I guess.</p>

<p> So, where do we go from here? If it were up to me, I'd go with teleportation or dimension shift.</p>

<p> Fran is trying to use dimensional storage, but it doesn't seem to be working. I guess she can't suck in the lava because Mordred has the control of the lava.</p>

<p> As I watched to see what she would do, Fran stepped forward again. She is on the same course as before, heading straight for Mordred.</p>

<p> Is she going to run straight at Mordred at the cost of taking damage?</p>

<p> As soon as Fran ran forward through the sea of lava toward the bottom again, the metal ball attacked her. Even I didn't notice it until just before it touched the barrier.</p>

<p> It was such a stealthy attack. However, Fran had succeeded in parrying the blow with the barrier.</p>

<p> She deformed the shape of the barrier slightly, which deflected the ball. I don't think she should have had enough time to deform the barrier as quickly as she did……</p>

<p> I thought it was a fluke, but Fran succeeded in preventing one attack after another.</p>

<p> The angle of the barrier was perfectly adjusted to deflect and sometimes repel the flying metal balls.</p>

<p> It was obvious that she could sense the movement of the metal balls.</p>

<p> But how? I have tried various ways, but the presence of the lava is blocking me, and I can't get it to work at all.</p>

<p> Moreover, Mordred is very good at hiding the presence of magic and the flow of magic power. He must have honed this skill by dealing with magical beasts that are unusually sensitive to the presence of magic.</p>

<p> I can't tell when he activated his magic, but before I knew it, the magic had already activated under our feet. It would not be easy even for me to keep on detecting the attacks of Mordred like this.</p>

<p> I'd love to hear how she's doing it, but I don't want to interrupt her right now. I'll ask later.</p>

<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>「Argh! Rising Impulse!」</p>

<p> After breaking through the wall of lava, we entered a small empty space surrounding Mordred. Fran immediately slashes at Mordred. Mordred, on the other hand, responded with martial arts.</p>

<p> He thrust his spear above his head and fired a shockwave into the air.</p>

<p> Mordred used this technique to kill Fran's momentum and then defended himself with a metal ball. Or that must have been his intention.</p>

<p> However, Fran used aerial movement to leaped down in the air and slash at Mordred while keeping her momentum.</p>

<p> The shockwave was blocked by the barrier at least minimally, and she twisted her body to make the spear miss her vital points. The left side of her abdomen was cut, but the wound was not fatal.</p>

<p> Then she used me to strike the metal balls blocking us in rapid succession.</p>

<p> Naturally, Mordred reacts quickly and I am entangled with five metal balls. From the outside, I look like a distorted metal baseball bat.</p>

<p> From Mordred's point of view, he succeeded in completely blocking Fran's weapon. However, his expression did not look good.</p>

<p> He must have realized that Fran had purposely hit the metal balls.</p>

<p> Yes, Fran did not avoid the metal balls, but intentionally attacked with me. As a result, I was pulled down so fast that she could not maintain her position after she landed on the ground and fell forward.</p>

<p> Mordred, on the other hand, was aiming to stop her by using a spear art, even though he didn't know Fran's intention.</p>

<p>「Quick Pierce!」</p>

<p> A quick pierce to the head of Fran. But this is exactly the moment Fran was aiming for.</p>

<p>「Taaaaah!」</p>
<p>「I've been lured!」</p>

<p> Fran thrusts me at Mordred. There were no metal balls attached to the blade.</p>

<p> Fran had used dimensional storage. She put me away for a split second, then took me out again. The metal spheres under Mordred's control cannot be stored, so only I am stored and then freed from the metal spheres.</p>

<p> Neither the metal balls, nor the spear, nor the needle armor will be able to stop Fran's sword in time.</p>

<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>「Gohu…… Gah!」</p>

<p> Mordred's thrust grazed Fran's left cheek, and at the same time, Fran's stab pierced through Mordred's stomach, and the black lightning burned his body from the inside. Mordred falls to the ground, smoke billowing from his body.</p>

<p> He's lost consciousness. Fran has won. It's a win, but……</p>

<p>『Fran! Use the dimensional storage!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>

<p> A huge amount of lava has come falling down all at once, having lost its master. If we don't do anything, Mordred will be caught with us in the middle.</p>

<p> The lava that was already out of Mordred's control can cleaned up via dimensional storage. The vast amount of lava all gets sucked into our storage.</p>

<p>『Whoa! Just when we thought the arena was covered with lava, now the lava suddenly disappears! What's more, the match has already been decided! What in the world happened inside! And, earth mages and healers, it's time to go to work!』</p>



<h2 id="ch708">708 Victory and Reflection</h2>

<p> Fran, who had won the match, was walking down the aisle to the special spectator seats.</p>

<p> She had used Brilliant Lightning Rush, and her magic and physical strength were exhausted. She must have taken a lot of damage too. I would like to let her rest at the inn if possible, but it is also important to gather information on the matches.</p>

<p> I will give her a good rest tomorrow, and let her be quiet while watching the matches today.</p>

<p> As Fran was walking silently, I asked her what had been bothering me about the Mordred match.</p>

<p>『Hey Fran, can I ask you something?』</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>『How did you detect Mordred's metal spheres in the lava? The magic was masked and it was hard to get a read on him, right?』</p>
<p>「Did you feel a tingle?」</p>
<p>『A tingle?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p> I don't know what you're talking about…… You mean you you sensed something with your natural instincts? Or is there something else?</p>

<p>『Tingle, huh? Can you be a little more specific?』</p>
<p>「Nn… a little bit of the magic I used left a tingle on the sphere.」</p>
<p>『Oh, really?』</p>

<p> If Fran's magic made the ball tingle, it must be lightning magic.</p>

<p> It seems that when it blocked the lightning magic, the magic power remained in the metal ball. I guess you could say it was electrified.</p>

<p> Fran's sense sharpened by Brilliant Lightning Rush seems to have caught that slight lightning attribute. It may not be unrelated to the fact that Black Heaven Tigers have a high affinity for the lightning attribute.</p>

<p> I wonder if I can do something like that if I try hard enough.</p>

<p>『Even so, you would have won even if I didn't participate.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p> Last year, when we fought against Colbert, a rank B adventurer of the same rank, I helped her out and we won by brute force after using physical attack negation.</p>

<p> This time, however, Fran won by herself.</p>

<p> However, Fran is looking somewhat unhappy.</p>

<p>『……Are you frustrated?』</p>
<p>「Nn……」</p>
<p>『Well, he's a veteran so of course he's taking the lead. That's one area that just can't be helped.』</p>
<p>「I know. But it's frustrating. Besides, I was a bit overconfident. I'll do better next time.」</p>

<p> Although she outplayed Mordred in the end, she had been at Mordred's mercy until that point.</p>

<p> He was not only skillful, but also anticipated Fran's personality to enjoy the battle.</p>

<p> In a sense, everything had been foreshadowing, and until the final Volcanic Gazer, the game was being played according to Mordred's plan.</p>

<p> Probably, Mordred had prepared several simulations in advance, and had prepared several plans for what he would do if Fran moved a certain way.</p>

<p> Even though Fran won, it was a disappointing match for her.</p>

<p>「He was great.」</p>
<p>『Yes, it was.』</p>

<p> Brilliant Lightning Rush, Sword God Form, dimensional magic, Swordking Arts. If we had went all in, there's a possible we could have won in the first few seconds of the match.</p>

<p> But all things considered that would just be brute force. If it were against a veteran player with the same level of power, it might not work. At least, it would not be an easy victory.</p>

<p> And I knew just such an opponent.</p>

<p>『Diaz is even worse.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p> I can't come up with any counter measures for him. But it was a great experience for us to fight Mordred here. We must make the most of this victory in the future.</p>

<p> As we were walking along, we heard some commotion in front of us.</p>

<p>「I'm sorry, sir!」</p>
<p>「Damn! If you're going to apologize, don't start acting like a fool from the beginning!」</p>

<p> Someone is making a scene with the adventurers. At first glance, it looks like the adventurers are at fault, but the soldier who rushes to the scene is angry with the man who is on his knees.</p>

<p> Perhaps he is a recruiter from the Kingdom of Shallus. As the guild had told me, they were causing a ruckus in many places.</p>

<p> The guards were giving him an exasperated warning, but the Shallus Kingdom people did not show any remorse. In any case, their apologies were all lies. They are probably going to keep trying to recruit us.</p>

<p>『Fran, let's get out of here before we get caught in the middle of this.』</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>

<p> I wonder what the Shallus Kingdom people are really after. They're gonna make it really hard for the guards. I wonder if they will be banned from the venue soon.</p>

<p> Back at the spectator seats, the game has not started yet. Since Mordred has turned the whole playing field into lava, and since Fran has stowed away all of it away.</p>

<p> But it was almost ready. Several magicians who could use earth magic proceeded to clear the ground and set up the stage. The workmanship was quite good.</p>

<p> And so the second match began……</p>

<p>『It's decided! The mercenary Biscott has pulled off a brilliant coup de grace to win the match!』</p>
<p>「It's over!」</p>

<p> Biscott had finished him off in seconds. I couldn't check out any of his moves or tactics. Well, complaining won't help.</p>

<p> But more importantly, the next match is coming up. After a few okayish games between unknown fighters, we have a must-see game coming up.</p>

<p> Fran knows this. She puts away her food and snacks and takes her hands off Urushi, who has was getting smothered. She straightens her back and stares quietly into the arena.</p>

<p> After all, the next match is between Sibylla and Colbert.</p>

<p>『Here comes the rank B adventurer, Colbert the Iron Claw! He is said to have left the Dimitris school, so what kind of fight will he show us? The first round was almost an instant kill, but what about the next round?』</p>

<p> As expected, the commentator would not use the negative word "expulsion". Still, I would like to see how Colbert will fight now that no longer has the Dimitris style.</p>

<p>『Against him is the red-haired mercenary Sibylla! Like Colbert, Sibylla showed us an impressive first-round KO in a blink of an eye! Let's see how close she can get to Colbert!』</p>

<p> Listening to the commentary and the reaction of the audience, it was clear that Sibylla was being treated as a lower rank. This is how unknown mercenaries are treated, I guess.</p>

<p> However, the two fighters themselves seem to have a different view. Sibylla lets out a chuckle of amusement, while Colbert glares at Sibylla with a stern expression.</p>

<p> If you are at Colbert's level, you know what Sibylla is capable of. The amount of magic he is weaving in his body is a sign of utmost vigilance.</p>

<p>「Colbert is starting off at full power?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, seems so.』</p>
<p>「Sibylla is just like me.」</p>

<p> You mean she's going to wait and see at the start. Let's see what happens.</p>

<p>『Let the games begin!』</p>



<h2 id="ch709">709 Sibylla vs Colbert</h2>

<p> The battle between Colbert and Sibylla begins.</p>

<p> Colbert is using his footwork, and at first glance, it seems as if he is waiting to see what will happen. However, I could clearly feel that he was planning to take advantage of the opportunity and decide the fight here.</p>

<p> Even so, Colbert's strength lies in his ability to wait and not attack recklessly.</p>

<p> Sibylla, on the other hand, did not move much and was completely amused by Colbert's moves. This is to be expected from a fighting maniac.</p>

<p> Fran did the same against Mordred and she was taken advantage of. On the other hand, if we ever fight a combat maniac, we might be able to take advantage of that as well.</p>

<p> Colbert slowly makes his way around the arena, keeping a certain distance.</p>

<p>「So you're a brawler, huh?」</p>
<p>「I'm used to fighting swordsmen. You're going to get hurt if you underestimate me just because I'm using bare hands, you know?」</p>
<p>「I see! I'm looking forward to it!」</p>

<p> The two were laughing happily and exchanging words with each other, but gradually the gap between them became narrower and narrower.</p>

<p>「You're going to get your ass kicked!」</p>
<p>「I don't want that!」</p>

<p> Before Colbert could move, Sibylla attacked.</p>

<p> Sibylla's overhead blow created a small crater in the center of the arena. This signaled the start of the fierce battle.</p>

<p> Colbert is only two levels higher than before, but his skills have increased considerably. He has probably spent less time fighting and more time training himself to compensate for the Dimitris style he has lost.</p>

<p> Sibylla, like Biscott, cannot be appraised. If Colbert breaks the magic item preventing appraisal, we'd be able to see though.</p>

<p> As I was thinking about this, they exchanged some light blows. Basically, Sibylla attacked and Colbert tried to counter while avoiding.</p>

<p> Colbert's defense is much more sophisticated than before, as he sometimes ducks Sibylla's very fast slashes and sometimes deflects with the back of his hand.</p>

<p> Sibylla's attacks seem rather rough. Her style of fighting is rather linear and power oriented, although she mixes in feints and other techniques. This is a good solution when fighting against monsters and beasts, but against humans, Sibylla's attacks are easily readable.</p>

<p>「Uraaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Kuh! What kind of ridiculous strength!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! You see, I'm confident only in my strength!」</p>
<p>「And you're too tough!」</p>
<p>「I'm confident in that too!」</p>

<p> Normally, a brute force opponent like Sibylla should be a sitting duck for Colbert. In fact, Colbert's attacks sometimes hit Sibylla, after he knocked her out of her stance by deflecting her sword.</p>

<p> It is an example of how skill trumps power.</p>

<p> However, Sibylla's toughness was surprising to see.</p>

<p> Colbert landed a skillful hook to the gut at a good angle, and she didn't even grunt. He just hit her in the face and the same thing happened.</p>

<p> She moves forward and slams her sword down, not caring about the sharp jab to the nose.</p>

<p> Each of Colbert's blows should have been enough to blow up a goblin.</p>

<p> She is taking damage. But her recovery and momentum are just superior. There was a high probability that she also had pain nullification. And maybe some other skills such as force resistance and perservation.</p>

<p> I did not expect Sibylla to be such a power fighter.</p>

<p> However, Colbert, who was surprised by Sibylla's violent fighting style, soon got back into the swing of things.</p>

<p> If it doesn't work, then just keep doing it until it does. And if they are taking it unprotected, then we should hit them with big moves to the vital points.</p>

<p> Moving up a gear, Colbert struck Sibylla in the stomach in rapid succession. He stops Sibylla's movement with body blows and then chains follow up attacks when she slowed down. That must have been his intention.</p>

<p> However, Sibylla's toughness seemed to exceed Colbert's expectations. We, who were watching, did not imagine her to be this tough either.</p>

<p> Even though she had been hit ten times in the stomach, her movements did not show any sign of slowing down at all. She was still wearing her animalistic smile and pressing hard against Colbert.</p>

<p> Gradually, Colbert's movements began to slow down. It looked like he was tired, but that wasn't the case.</p>

<p>「Haha! I've seen that one already!」</p>
<p>「Kuh! That was close!」</p>
<p>「Ora! Take this!」</p>
<p>「Seriously!」</p>

<p> Sibylla's attacks began to grow more severe, as if she was anticipating Colbert's movements.</p>

<p> She began to move her sword at angles that were difficult for Colbert to defend against, to anticipate the direction in which he would duck and turn around, and even to parry and counter attacks that were launched as counters.</p>

<p> It seems that Sibylla had begun to get used to Colbert's moves during the battle. Sibylla's fighting instincts and adaptability were frightening.</p>

<p> Finally, Sibylla's sword grazes Colbert's body. Just by that, Colbert's posture had been greatly disrupted. After all, the simple destructive power of the sword seems to be considerable.</p>

<p>「Whoa!」</p>
<p>「Haha! I'll take that!」</p>
<p>「I won't let you!」</p>
<p>「You're still fighting back in that condition, not bad!」</p>

<p> Colbert manages to get away from Sibylla, who comes after him, by throwing kicks at her. He seemed to have treated the wound on his left arm tightening his muscle. The bleeding has already stopped.</p>

<p> However, it is certain that he could not easily use his left arm any more. Sibylla, on the other hand, still looked healthy.</p>

<p>「Sibylla, amazing!」</p>
<p>『Oh, that toughness…… I'm sure it's not just a high status.』</p>
<p>（Skill?）</p>
<p>『I think so……』</p>

<p> I don't think it's a barrier. There was no sign of magic movement. If she was using physical nullification, it would be strange for the spots where she was hit to turn red.</p>

<p> Colbert must be aware of this.</p>

<p>「……I don't know what kind of trick it is, but it nullifies damage below a certain level…… Or just reduction? Anyway, I know that it doesn't matter how many weak attacks I put in.」</p>
<p>「Heh? You've got a good eye. What now?」</p>
<p>「I'm going to hit you with a blow so heavy that it won't matter if it's mitigated or not!」</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! Correct answer!」</p>

<p> Hey, hey! Sibylla admitted it, didn't she? She's not lying! She really has a damage reduction skill!</p>

<p> Sibylla gives a big smile, while Colbert starts walking forward slowly. There is no stance, just a normal pace.</p>

<p> However, I could feel the tremendous magical energy building up inside his body. The magical power once concentrated in the abdomen now circulated through the body and was concentrated again, repeating the cycle, gradually permeating his entire body with a powerful magical power.</p>

<p> After ten seconds. The distance between the two approaches about five meters. But Colbert is still walking slowly.</p>

<p>「Shaaa!」</p>

<p> Sibylla slashes at Colbert with a somewhat excited look on her face.</p>

<p> And the next moment. Sibylla's figure disappears with a tremendous crash.</p>

<p> In the place where Sibylla had been, Colbert, who had been walking slowly just a moment before, was standing still in the same position as he had just launched a direct thrust.</p>

<p>『Did you see that?』</p>
<p>（Nn! He moved very fast, emitting magic power from the feet and back.）</p>

<p> Using the release of magic power, he super-accelerated in an instant. The speed itself was a little slower than that of Fran, but it seemed faster because of the instantaneous rapid acceleration. To many of the spectators, it must have looked as if he had moved instantaneously.</p>

<p> Moreover, it was very difficult to perceive the attack because there was almost no preliminary movement of the attack. Movement from stillness. The acceleration with very little muscle power would have caught even Sibylla and Fran off guard. There was almost no sign of an attack.</p>

<p> What is amazing is that they did not even feel the killing intent. This would have been impossible without mental control.</p>

<p> Sibylla was sent flying horizontally with tremendous momentum. She was going to lose the match by exiting the ring. That's what everyone thought right, then right afterwards…</p>

<p>「Uruaaaaaaaah!」</p>

<p> Sibylla roars like an animal. Sibylla's body is suddenly still in the air. It was not aerial movement. It was not a magic release. Her momentum was killed in an instant. Moreover, she floated there silently. If I had to say, it was like my telekinesis.</p>

<p>「Buh……! Aaaaahhhh!」</p>

<p> Her organs must have been damaged. Sibylla spits out a glob of blood from her mouth. Was it her lungs that were hit? Sibylla's breathing sounds very labored.</p>

<p> But Sibylla does not stop moving. She thrusts her left hand forward with great force. The distance between the two is more than 20 meters, but…</p>

<p>「GGGHHH!」</p>

<p> This time, Colbert is knocked away. Forget being similar, this is just plain telekinesis. Sibylla seems to be a very powerful telekinetic user.</p>

<p> Sibylla flies toward Colbert who is thrown into the air. It seems that Sibylla is flying not by Telekinetic Catapult but by levitating her whole body with telekinesis.</p>

<p> Well. Telekinetic catapult would be a tremendous strain on a human body. However, the speed is fast enough, probably due to the huge amount of magic power.</p>

<p>「Uraaaaahhhh! Get crushed!」</p>
<p>「Tchi!」</p>

<p> Colbert managed to avoid Sibylla's slash by changing his stance in the air using magic release, but his movements were lackluster.</p>

<p> His whole body seemed to be screaming from the previous attack. Sibylla grabbed Colbert's right arm, which he failed to keep away from her.</p>

<p>「I've got youuuu!」</p>

<p> Sibylla, with a vicious smile on her face, head-butted Colbert. Yes, just a head butt.</p>

<p> Sibylla's head collided with Colbert's head.</p>

<p> With a deafening cracking sound, Colbert fell down. Without any movement to break his fall, he slammed onto the stage.</p>

<p>「Haha…… Gof…… It, was a good fight……」</p>

<p> Sibylla, still bleeding from the corners of her mouth, laughs happily.</p>

<p>『It's settled! What a head butt at the end! I heard a terrible sound! I wonder if Colbert's head is okay! Healing magician! Please hurry!』</p>

<p> The sorcerer rushes in immediately, but will Colbert be alright?</p>

<p>「…I'm going to Colbert.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, yeah.』</p>

<h2 id="ch710">710 Colbert and Hilt</h2>

<p>「Colbert, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Oh, Fran……」</p>

<p> When we entered the infirmary, we found Colbert lying on the bed with a bandage wrapped around his head. When Fran called out to him, he was able to respond normally.</p>

<p> I wondered what would happen to him after the terrible head-butt, but it seems that he was saved by a healing spell.</p>

<p> However, his skull was caved in and he suffered fractures from the fall. In addition, the recoil from special technique he delivered to Sibylla damaged every muscle in his body, and for a time he appeared to be in danger.</p>

<p> He is sullen and drooping.</p>

<p>「I've lost.」</p>
<p>「Nn, I saw that.」</p>
<p>「Huh. I know it's my fault that my best moves didn't work. I know it wouldn't take her down, but I thought I could at least knock her out of the ring……」</p>
<p>「That was a great thrust.」</p>
<p>「Yeah? It's my own special technique that I developed after I was expelled from the Dimitris school, but……」</p>
<p>「But?」</p>
<p>「It's not complete.」</p>

<p> Dimitris school is a school that utilizes magical discharge. It has a wide variety of uses, including far-reaching attacks by shooting ki and strengthening the body with ki.</p>

<p> However, because of the sealing of the Dimitris style, Colbert's ability to use ki, which he had taken for granted, has been greatly reduced.</p>

<p> However, he still had some of the skills he had acquired, such as 'magic release', and he wondered if he could somehow use them in a different way.</p>

<p>「During a request, I fought with a magical beast that moved at high speed by releasing magical power. You know how their movements are hard to detect, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p> Basically, they release magic power behind them, accelerate, and rush forward. It's hard to predict how it moves by looking at their muscles and body movements.</p>

<p>「That's how I came up with the idea. I thought that if I could use the release of magic power, I could eliminate the initial movements of my attack.」</p>
<p>「That's what you were doing?」</p>
<p>「Yes. But it takes too much time to build up the power before. In a match like this, you can't apply it unless your opponent waits for you to attack. It will take a long time before I can use it in a real fight. Besides, it's not that powerful……」</p>
<p>「Sibylla got blasted away.」</p>
<p>「Even so, it's just a fast punch. I'm thinking that if you put magic into the attack itself, it'll make it perfect.」</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>

<p> A strike coming out of a neutral stance with extreme speed. And the cherry on top will be magic release causing internal organ destruction. This must be Colbert's ideal.</p>

<p>「Then… Even Fran would take damage from that too, right?」</p>

<p> Colbert was thinking of this as a countermeasure to the physical nullification we were using last year.</p>

<p>「Dimitris style specializes in ki manipulation. It is a tremendous advantage to be able to use martial arts and techniques at a distance…… But Fran's ability nullifies not only fists, but also ki. Because of that, all the Dimitris style techniques were useless. I'm sure the young lady and the Master can do something about that though.」</p>

<p> Ki and magic are almost the same, but there are some subtle differences. The magic inside the body is ki. The external one is called mana.</p>

<p> If you ask what the difference is, I and Fran don't really know…… Dimitris style seems to clarify the difference and is based on releasing ki out of the body.</p>

<p> By releasing Ki at a long distance, it seems to be possible to use fist techniques that would normally only be used in close contact. Is it like attacking by manipulating a fist made of ki?</p>

<p> However, our physical nullification will also repel the ki. Otherwise, there is no explanation for the fact that we were able to completely nullify Colbert's various attacks using ki last year.</p>

<p>「That's why I was going to hit her with magic power instead of ki……」</p>

<p> As Colbert said, if magic is released into the body at such a distance, even physical nullification would not work. However, as the word "unfinished" implies, it seems that Colbert has not mastered it yet. He seems to have used up all of his magic power by propelling himself.</p>

<p>「Well, I'll show you the finished product one of these days.」</p>
<p>「I look forward to it.」</p>
<p>「Yeah…」</p>

<p> Boom!</p>

<p> Colbert smiled and nodded. Then the door to the infirmary opens with a force that threatens to send him flying.</p>

<p>「Colbert!」</p>
<p>「Whoa! M-miss Hilt?」</p>

<p> A scary-looking Hilt jumps in. She looks around the infirmary with a piercing gaze that is almost as sharp as a gunshot.</p>

<p>「Hmm, looks like you're okay.」</p>

<p> I thought she was angry with Colbert for the defeat, but she was just in a panic. After seeing Fran conversing with Colbert, she was clearly breathing a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>「You are Fran, the Black Thunder Princess…… Why are you here?」</p>
<p>「To see him.」</p>
<p>「I see. I appreciate it.」</p>
<p>「Why would Hilt thank me?」</p>
<p>「What? Well, he's a former member of our school! S-So, I just came to check his injuries!」</p>
<p>「Hmmm…」</p>

<p> Hilt is looking very nervous. Her face is bright red and it's all too obvious.</p>

<p> But Colbert seems completely oblivious to Hilt's feelings.</p>

<p>「Sorry to bother you, miss.」</p>
<p>「Oh…… Yes, yes! Yes, you're right! How can you be defeated by such an no name mercenary! That proves you've been slacking on your training!」</p>
<p>「Haha. That's harsh.」</p>
<p>「W-well, I can train you again, I suppose?」</p>

<p> Isn't this a subtle way of saying that she wants Dimitris to come back? But Colbert, it seems, was one of those oblivious protagonist types.</p>

<p>「I've been expelled. I can't go back to the Dimitris school.」</p>
<p>「…!」</p>

<p> Hilt is frustrated. She is frustrated with Colbert for not reading her intentions, and with herself for not being honest.</p>

<p> This is so obvious that it's impressive he doesn't seem to notice it. Well, it's not easy to notice one's own bias, even if people around you tell you otherwise. I have also made mistakes in some of the games I used to play because of my bias.</p>

<p> Maybe in Colbert's mind, Hilt is nothing more than the heiress to school, and one who is very strict to him. It is impossible for her to fall in love with me, or so he thinks.</p>

<p>「That's enough! Fran, I'm going to win!」</p>

<p> With these words, Hilt stormed off. The look she gave Fran at the end was full of hostility, since she was the reason for Colbert's expulsion and now she was the one who had to be defeated in order to make her love bear fruit. If they were to fight now, she would be even more fired up than before.</p>

<p>「Uhh, I'm sorry about the lady.」</p>

<p> We can't lose either, but we'll be rooting for you behind the scenes.</p>
