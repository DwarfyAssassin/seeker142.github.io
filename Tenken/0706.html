<p>「This is the new trump card I just developed!」</p>

<p>Mordred turns the bag of items removed from his waist upside down and shakes it gently up and down. Softball-sized metal balls fell out of the bag. A total of ten metal balls rolled out with a thud.</p>

<p>According to the results of my appraisal, they were called magicontrol alloy balls.</p>

<p>Mordred holds up his spear as he lightly rolls the metal balls under his feet.</p>

<p>「Spellshroud.」</p>

<p>Mordred muttered the name of his unique skill, and a reddish-black colored light rose from his whole body. It was molten magic.</p>

<p>Is this a full-body version of the Elemental Sword? Or does it have other abilities? I soon found out what it was capable of.</p>

<p>「Vulcanus Order!」</p>
<p>「!」</p>

<p>Before Fran's astonished eyes, the magic was activated. I knew this trick before. He had manipulated a huge anchor to bind a kraken and water dragons. It is a high-level molten magic that allows one to manipulate metal within range at will.</p>

<p>It used to require a long chant. He's doing all that with just the name of the spell? The results of the pre-match appraisal showed that he did not possess any chant cancel or chantless casting skills.</p>

<p>Was it the effect of spellshroud?</p>

<p>Metal balls start to dance wildly in front of us. He may not be serious yet, but they are quite fast. Even in this state, if they hit us, they will probably break our bones.</p>

<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>「I'm fully prepared for lightning magic!」</p>

<p>Before Fran is attacked, she releases a lightning spell.</p>

<p>In response, five metal balls protect Mordred like a shield. Then, Fran's thunder spell was bounced off and disappeared as if blocked by an invisible wall.</p>

<p>It seems that the magical power swirling around the metal ball acted as a barrier.</p>

<p>「Get crushed!」</p>
<p>「Not happening.」</p>

<p>Fran was forced on the defensive. Mordred moved his hand lightly, and the metal spheres attacked Fran at once.</p>

<p>Some of them were straight, some of them were arcing, and all of them were moving in different ways. Yet, they were able to drive Fran into a corner with precision.</p>

<p>He seems to have perfect control over the 10 metal balls.</p>

<p>Fran quickly knocked away the metal spheres, but even that was within Mordred's prediction. As soon as they hit me, the metal spheres deformed. I didn't feel a clean cut, it was if I had hit been hit with gelatin.</p>

<p>It is the same as the spear from before. The ball of metal is still entangled in my blade and won't come off. Fran can handle the extra weight, but it still prevents that part of the blade from cutting.</p>

<p>And that wasn't the only problem.</p>

<p>「What?」</p>

<p>Fran shouts in surprise when I suddenly make a move of my own.</p>

<p>『It wasn't me!』</p>

<p>Yes, it wasn't me. The metal wrapped around the blade was pulled in an unexpected direction by Mordred's manipulation.</p>

<p>This causes the metal ball to collide with my sword blade again, adding more weight to it.</p>

<p>Moreover, I felt a tremendous sense of discomfort. It was as if I was being forced to use the morphic transformation against my will. Perhaps Mordred's molten magic was working on me through the metal ball.</p>

<p>It seems that he can't manipulate me directly, but my concentration is being disturbed enough. I'll have to be careful from now on when dealing with molten magic wizards.</p>

<p>Fran is managing to force me under her control, even though I was not moving as she wanted me to. She is able to keep dodging but her escape route is gradually diminishing.</p>

<p>While evading, she was pulled to the other side and was lightly hit several times. Although they were still only grazes, they must have judged that it was dangerous to continue.</p>

<p>Fran moved forward, lowering herself.</p>

<p>She avoided the metal ball that tried to block his way with minimal movement while putting up a barrier. Just when it seemed that she was going to break through the encirclement of the metal balls…</p>

<p>「Gagh!」</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>

<p>Fran suddenly loses her position and almost falls. Her right leg sank into the ground as if it was buried.</p>

<p>She quickly put her hand on it and twisted her body to prevent herself from falling, but the condition of her right leg was quite bad.</p>

<p>It was burned and turned to ash in some places. It seemed that the lava had been made under the ground, and had been calculated to drop someone's foot into the lava when they stepped on it.</p>

<p>This was only possible to survive because Fran had covered her entire body with magic power, but if she had been your average magical beast or human, her foot would have been burned off and gone.</p>

<p>「Ugh!」</p>

<p>I quickly heal her with recovery magic, but in the meantime, Mordred moves on to his next action.</p>

<p>「Magma Field!」</p>

<p>Mordred puts his hands on the stage and pours magic power into the stage. The ground around Mordred starts to heat up red-hot at once.</p>

<p>The tremendous heat was so intense that Fran was forced to flee to the sky in a hurry.</p>

<p>The range of the heat increased rapidly, and all the ground in the arena was heated to a bright red. The stone stage was melting into mush, and the inside of the arena was a complete sea of lava.</p>

<p>Mordred was standing on the lava with a cool face due to the effect of his molten magic.</p>

<p>「Lightning bolt!」</p>
<p>「Block it!」</p>
<p>「Mwah!」</p>

<p>Fran's magic is still blocked by the metal ball. The superiority of the offensive side of Mordred's magic had been obvious, but the defensive power of the metal spheres was also troublesome.</p>

<p>The metal spheres are still orbiting around Mordred. It would take a lot of offensive power to break through.</p>

<p>Mordred looks up at Fran. Was he trying to force Fran into the air to take away her mobility? If so, that's a bit naive.</p>

<p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush!」</p>

<p>Fran has used her trump card.</p>

<p>With aerial movement and Brilliant Lightning Rush, she can fight at the same speed as on the ground. No, she can even move faster in the air.</p>

<p>Fran is flying around the arena with me in position to counter Mordred's moves. As soon as she sees an opening, she's ready to dive in at the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>But even this was within Mordred's grasp.</p>

<p>「I knew that your speed was beyond my control.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「That's why I'm going to hit you with everything I've got while you're still waiting to see what happens!」</p>

<p>It's impossible for him to hit a serious Fran with a normal attack. In that case, hit everything.</p>

<p>The magma field was not meant to drive Fran into the air, but as preparation for this attack.</p>

<p>「Volcanic--」</p>

<p>Mordred's hands, which had been lowered in a lazy motion, are lifted lightly, and only his wrists rotate with a jerk. If you are a tokusatsu enthusiast, you will understand if I tell you that it is the pose of Sh*n-Godzilla.</p>

<p>As if in response to his palms facing the sky, the magma around him begins to swell.</p>

<p>「--Geyser!」</p>

<p>And then the lava covering the ground of the arena explodes, filling inside of the barrier with lava.</p>
