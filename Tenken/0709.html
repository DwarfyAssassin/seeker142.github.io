<h2 id="ch709">709: Sibylla vs Colbert</h2>

<p>The battle between Colbert and Sibylla begins.</p>

<p>Colbert is using his footwork, and at first glance, it seems as if he is waiting to see what will happen. However, I could clearly feel that he was planning to take advantage of the opportunity and decide the fight here.</p>

<p>Even so, Colbert's strength lies in his ability to wait and not attack recklessly.</p>

<p>Sibylla, on the other hand, did not move much and was completely amused by Colbert's moves. This is to be expected from a fighting maniac.</p>

<p>Fran did the same against Mordred and she was taken advantage of. On the other hand, if we ever fight a combat maniac, we might be able to take advantage of that as well.</p>

<p>Colbert slowly makes his way around the arena, keeping a certain distance.</p>

<p>「So you're a brawler, huh?」</p>
<p>「I'm used to fighting swordsmen. You're going to get hurt if you underestimate me just because I'm using my bare hands, you know?」</p>
<p>「I see! I'm looking forward to it!」</p>

<p>The two were laughing happily and exchanging words with each other, but gradually the gap between them became narrower and narrower.</p>

<p>「You're going to get your ass kicked!」</p>
<p>「I don't want that!」</p>

<p>Before Colbert could move, Sibylla attacked.</p>

<p>Sibylla's overhead blow created a small crater in the center of the arena. This signaled the start of the fierce battle.</p>

<p>Colbert is only two levels higher than before, but his skills have increased considerably. He has probably spent less time fighting and more time training himself to compensate for the Dimitris style he has lost.</p>

<p>Sibylla, like Biscot, cannot be appraised. If Colbert breaks the magic item preventing appraisal, we'd be able to see though.</p>

<p>As I was thinking about this, they exchanged some light blows. Basically, Sibylla attacked and Colbert tried to counter while avoiding.</p>

<p>Colbert's defense is much more sophisticated than before, as he sometimes ducks Sibylla's very fast slashes and sometimes deflects with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>Sibylla's attacks seem rather rough. Her style of fighting is rather linear and power oriented, although she mixes in feints and other techniques. This is a good solution when fighting against monsters and beasts, but against humans, Sibylla's attacks are easily readable.</p>

<p>「Uraaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Kuh! What kind of ridiculous strength!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! You see, I'm confident only in my strength!」</p>
<p>「And you're too tough!」</p>
<p>「I'm confident in that too!」</p>

<p>Normally, a brute force opponent like Sibylla should be a sitting duck for Colbert. In fact, Colbert's attacks sometimes hit Sibylla, such as how he just knocked her out of her stance by deflecting her sword.</p>

<p>It is an example of how skill trumps power.</p>

<p>However, Sibylla's toughness was surprising to see.</p>

<p>Colbert landed a skillful hook to the gut at a good angle, and she didn't even grunt. He just hit her in the face and the same thing happened.</p>

<p>She moves forward and slams her sword down, showing no signs of caring about a sharp jab to the nose.</p>

<p>Each of Colbert's blows should have been enough to blow up a goblin.</p>

<p>She is taking damage. But her recovery and momentum are just superior. There was a high probability that she also had pain nullification. And maybe some other skills such as force resistance and perseverance.</p>

<p>I did not expect Sibylla to be such a power fighter.</p>

<p>However, Colbert, who was surprised by Sibylla's violent fighting style, soon got back into the swing of things.</p>

<p>If it doesn't work, then just keep doing it until it does. And if they are taking it unprotected, then we should hit them with big moves to the vital points.</p>

<p>Moving up a gear, Colbert delivered a series of blows to Sibylla's stomach in rapid succession. He stops Sibylla's movement with body blows and then chains follow up attacks when she slowed down. That must have been his intention.</p>

<p>However, Sibylla's toughness seemed to exceed Colbert's expectations. We, who were watching, did not imagine her to be this tough either.</p>

<p>Even though she had been hit ten times in the stomach, her movements did not show any sign of slowing down at all. She was still wearing her animalistic smile and pressing hard against Colbert.</p>

<p>Gradually, Colbert's movements began to slow down. It looked like he was tired, but that wasn't the case.</p>

<p>「Haha! I've seen that one already!」</p>
<p>「Kuh! That was close!」</p>
<p>「Ora! Take this!」</p>
<p>「Seriously!」</p>

<p>Sibylla's attacks began to grow more severe, as if she was anticipating Colbert's movements.</p>

<p>She began to move her sword at angles that were difficult for Colbert to defend against, to anticipate the direction in which he would duck and turn around, and even to parry and counter attacks that were launched as counters.</p>

<p>It seems that Sibylla had begun to get used to Colbert's moves during the battle. Sibylla's fighting instincts and adaptability were frightening.</p>

<p>Finally, Sibylla's sword grazes Colbert's body. Just by that, Colbert's posture had been greatly disrupted. After all, the sheer destructive power of the sword seems to be quite considerable.</p>

<p>「Whoa!」</p>
<p>「Haha! I'll take that!」</p>
<p>「I won't let you!」</p>
<p>「You're still fighting back in that condition, not bad!」</p>

<p>Colbert manages to get away from Sibylla, who comes after him, by throwing kicks at her. He seemed to have treated the wound on his left arm by tightening his muscles. The bleeding has already stopped.</p>

<p>However, it is certain that he could not easily use his left arm any more. Sibylla, on the other hand, still looked healthy.</p>

<p>「Sibylla, amazing!」</p>
<p>『Oh, that toughness…… I'm sure it's not just high stats.』</p>
<p>（A skill?）</p>
<p>『I think so……』</p>

<p>But I don't think it's a barrier. There was no sign of magic movement. Also if she was using physical nullification, it would be strange for the spots where she was hit to turn red.</p>

<p>Colbert must be aware of this.</p>

<p>「……I don't know what kind of trick it is, but it nullifies damage below a certain level…… Or just reduction? Anyway, I know that it doesn't matter how many weak attacks I put in.」</p>
<p>「Heh? You've got a good eye. What now?」</p>
<p>「I'm going to hit you with a blow so heavy that it won't matter if it's mitigated or not!」</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! Correct answer!」</p>

<p>Hey, hey! Sibylla admitted it, didn't she? She's not lying! She really has a damage reduction skill!</p>

<p>Sibylla gives a big smile, while Colbert starts walking forward slowly. There is no stance, just a normal pace.</p>

<p>However, I could feel the tremendous magical energy building up inside his body. The magical power once concentrated in the abdomen now circulated through the body and was concentrated again, repeating the cycle, gradually permeating his entire body with a powerful energy.</p>

<p>After ten seconds. The distance between the two approaches about five meters. But Colbert is still walking slowly.</p>

<p>「Shaaa!」</p>

<p>Sibylla slashes at Colbert with a somewhat excited look on her face.</p>

<p>And the next moment. Sibylla's figure disappears with a tremendous crash.</p>

<p>In the place where Sibylla had been, Colbert, who had been walking slowly just a moment before, was standing still in the same position as he had just launched a direct thrust.</p>

<p>『Did you see that?』</p>
<p>（Nn! He moved very fast, emitting magic power from the feet and back.）</p>

<p>Using the release of magic power, he super-accelerated in an instant. The speed itself was a little slower than that of Fran, but it seemed faster because of the instantaneous rapid acceleration. To many of the spectators, it must have looked as if he had teleported.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was very difficult to perceive the attack because the usual signs of movement were not there. He suddenly dashed from pure stillness. The acceleration with very little muscle movement would certainly catch Sibylla and even Fran off guard.</p>

<p>What is also amazing is that I did not even feel the killing intent. This would have been impossible without mental control.</p>

<p>Sibylla was sent flying horizontally with tremendous momentum. She was going to lose the match by exiting the ring. That's what everyone thought right, then right afterwards…</p>

<p>「Uruaaaaaaaah!」</p>

<p>Sibylla roars like an animal. Sibylla's body is suddenly still in the air. It was not aerial movement. It was not a magic release. Her momentum was killed in an instant. Moreover, she floated there silently. If I had to say, it was like my telekinesis.</p>

<p>「Buh……! Aaaaahhhh!」</p>

<p>Her organs must have been damaged. Sibylla spits out a glob of blood from her mouth. Was it her lungs that were hit? Sibylla's breathing sounds very labored.</p>

<p>But Sibylla does not stop moving. She thrusts her left hand forward with great force. The distance between the two is more than 20 meters, but…</p>

<p>「Gghhh!」</p>

<p>This time, Colbert is knocked away. Forget being similar, this is just plain telekinesis. Sibylla seems to be a very powerful telekinetic user.</p>

<p>Sibylla flies toward Colbert who is thrown into the air. It seems that Sibylla is flying not by Telekinetic Catapult but by levitating her whole body with telekinesis.</p>

<p>Well. Telekinetic catapult would be a tremendous strain on a human body. However, the speed is fast enough, probably due to the huge amount of magic power she's putting in.</p>

<p>「Uraaaaahhhh! Get crushed!」</p>
<p>「Tchi!」</p>

<p>Colbert managed to avoid Sibylla's slash by changing his stance in the air using magic release, but his movements were lackluster.</p>

<p>His whole body seemed to be screaming from the previous attack. Sibylla grabbed Colbert's right arm, which he failed to keep away from her.</p>

<p>「I've got youuuu!」</p>

<p>Sibylla, with a vicious smile on her face, head-butted Colbert. Yes, just a head butt.</p>

<p>Sibylla's head collided with Colbert's head.</p>

<p>With a deafening cracking sound, Colbert fell from the sky. Without any movement to break his fall, he slammed onto the stage.</p>

<p>「Haha…… Gof…… It, was a good fight……」</p>

<p>Sibylla, still bleeding from the corners of her mouth, laughs happily.</p>

<p>『It's settled! What a head butt at the end! I heard a terrible sound! I wonder if Colbert's head is okay! Healing magician! Please hurry!』</p>

<p>The sorcerer rushes in immediately, but will Colbert be alright?</p>

<p>「…I'm going to Colbert.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, yeah.』</p>
