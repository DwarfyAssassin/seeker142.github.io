<h2 id="ch714">714: Warriors Climbing the Ranks</h2>
<p>『Fran, you did a great job!』</p>
<p>（Nn. I tried to imitate Mordred.）</p>
<p>『You still have a lot to learn and experience to gain. But you truly deserve praise for pulling off a win like that.』</p>
<p>（Really?）</p>
<p>『Yeah! Beating up your opponent is not the only way to win.』</p>
<p>（Nn!）</p>

<p>The battle with Mordred seems to have affected Fran in more ways than I had imagined.</p>

<p>After all, she used a trick like that in a situation where even I was expecting her to use a power move. I didn't think she will learn this kind of thinking right away, but if she can rely on things other than brute force, her combat repertoire would improve.</p>

<p>This should be a big plus for Fran in the future.</p>

<p>This style will still need a bit of honing, but one day she will be able to use it well. I look forward to that day.</p>

<p>『Well, we'll have to see who our next opponent will be.』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>

<p>The winner of the next match will face Fran in the quarterfinals.</p>

<p>Five minutes later.</p>

<p>「Sibylla.」</p>
<p>『I knew it.』</p>

<p>Her opponent was a huge mace user who looked up to Elsa. The destructive power of the mace must have been quite impressive. But Sibylla did not back down a single step from such a powerful opponent. They went at it head-on and she won in less than a minute.</p>

<p>I would have never expected her to stay her ground after taking a direct hit from that giant mace. I doubt any half-assed attack will put a dent in her. This time, we will have to get serious.</p>

<p>「……Strong.」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>

<p>The matches went on, and the winners of Block B were Eiworth's disciple Abarb as well as Diaz. Both defeated their opponents with ease. I remember Diaz and Eiworth were former party members, so it won't exactly be a master-student fight, but it should still be one to watch.</p>

<p>Next up is the battle between Hilt and Ladur.</p>

<p>『Another match up between wildly different competitors.』</p>

<p>Ladur, who uses a variety of magic to mess with his opponent, and Hilt, a brawler that fights with power.</p>

<p>What kind of battle will this be?</p>

<p>In terms of simple strength, magical power, and speed, it seems obvious that Hilt will win.</p>

<p>However, this is not the only factor that determines the winner. Differences in experience and strategy are quite significant in martial arts competitions.</p>

<p>『Will Master Ladur, who is a master of the three attributes of upper level magic, once again use his various magic skills to trick his opponents and seal their movements? Or will the rank A adventurer, Hiltoria of the 'Piercing Fist', crush the old sorcerer with her overwhelming power? Don't ask me because I have no clue!』</p>

<p>Ladur and Hilt moved as soon as the match started.</p>

<p>「Aaah!」</p>
<p>「Hmph!」</p>

<p>Hilt rushes forward, Ladur flies back. Are their speeds about the same?</p>

<p>Ladur must have used some kind of speed-boosting technique before the match. Maybe wind foot from wind magic.</p>

<p>「Oh.」</p>
<p>『Old man Ladur is pretty good.』</p>

<p>Ladur was gliding around the playing field like a figure skater. It must be the effect of wind foot. But it should be very difficult to control it like that. We've only ever used it to help us move in a straight line.</p>

<p>While performing such extremely difficult magic control, I could see that he was further developing their magic power for the next spell. It was nothing short of amazing.</p>

<p>Ladur may have been the best contestant when it came to the delicate control of magic.</p>

<p>Hilt followed closely behind him. With sharp moves, she quickly closed the distance.</p>

<p>「Earth Control!」</p>
<p>「What are you--?」</p>

<p>A huge amount of magical power emanates from Ladur. Just after Hilt senses this and becomes alert. Her body was flying in the air.</p>

<p>Her foot had been caught on a slight ridge that Ladur had created with his land magic. She twisted her body in the air and managed to land on the ground, but her body was off balance.</p>

<p>「That was!」</p>
<p>『He didn't hide his magic power, but covered his surroundings with magic power to make it difficult to see the small changes. I see!』</p>
<p>「Amazing!」</p>

<p>The technique Ladur used is earth control.</p>

<p>A person of Hilt's level would have been able to see through the flow of magic. If he had casted it normally that is.</p>

<p>Ladur had set up earth control over the entire stage to create a difference of only a few centimeters. It was as if he was declaring that he was going to perform a great move to attack the entire stage.</p>

<p>In reality, however, he had made a tiny change. This is a very nasty move that can surprise the opponent and cover up small changes in mana.</p>

<p>The disadvantage is that it consumes a lot of magic power.</p>

<p>Even so, Ladur seems to have decided that it is worth it if it can hinder Hilt's movement even a little.</p>

<p>「Here you go!」</p>
<p>「Peh!」</p>

<p>Using his ongoing earth control, he turned the ground under Hilt's feet into a pool of mud. The mud splashed on her face and Hilt frowned.</p>

<p>No matter how high her stats are, if she suddenly loses her footing, she is bound to lose her balance. Then, Ladur goes all in on the offensive.</p>

<p>「I will not make the same mistake I made last year! I must end the fight quickly when fighting one such as you! Ooourgh! High Wave!」</p>
<p>「I can never let my guard down around you old men!」</p>

<p>Ladur is known for his mastery of weak magic, but it does not mean that he cannot use powerful spells. Usually, he does not need them because of the drain on his magic.</p>

<p>However, when the game is on the line, he naturally must use his secret weapon.</p>

<p>Ladur unleashed an ocean magic that creates huge waves. If used on the sea, this technique could even capsize a ship.</p>

<p>Used in this narrow arena, it could push the opponent out of the arena.</p>

<p>A tall wall of waves hits Hilt as it rises.</p>

<p>Many in the audience were convinced that Hilt would be swallowed by the wave and lose outright. However, the next moment, their predictions would be betrayed.</p>

<p>「Ruaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>「Gohgg!」</p>

<p>Hilt had released a magic bullet, which had smashed straight through the wave and blown Ladur away.</p>

<p>『Such power released without any time lag. Hilt's magic release is several orders of magnitude better than Colbert's. That alone is enough to make her a threat.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>The collision with the wave should have made the bullet less powerful, but Ladur was knocked unconscious by the blow. I guess he can't physically beat the passing of the years, after all.</p>

<p>『T-This is…! Just when it looked like Ladur was going to win! Hiltoria's mysterious attack blew his body away! As expected from the heir to the 'Immovable'! Her strength is unbelievable!』</p>

<p>At first glance, it seemed that Ladur had put up a good fight, but Hilt was not taking the match seriously at all. Her goal was not to enjoy the match like Fran and the others, but to hide her own cards as much as possible.</p>

<p>Of course, she was hiding them from Fran.</p>

<p>Hilt, who had won the match, looked straight at us. Like I thought, she was constantly wary of Fran's presence.</p>
