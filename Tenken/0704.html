<h2 id="ch704">704: Strong Opponents</h2>

<p>Today is the second day of the first round. The C and D blocks are having their matches.</p>

<p>「Hilt is out.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>

<p>We're sitting in our special seats again today, observing them.</p>

<p>Fran is sitting in front of Urushi, hugging him from behind and resting her chin on his head, enjoying the fluffy feeling of his fur.</p>

<p>『Now, what kind of match are you going to show me?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>I appraise Hilt, who has appeared in the arena. She is strong as expected.</p>


<p>Name: Hiltoria Age: 23</p>
<p>Race: Human</p>
<p>Occupation: Magic Pugilist</p>
<p>Status Level: 61/99</p>
<p>HP: 682 MP: 582 STR: 410 VIT: 262 AGI: 589 INT: 197 MAG: 366 DEX: 314</p>
<p>Skills</p>
<p>Foot Sense: Lv 4, Intimidation: Lv 6, Super Strength: Lv 6, Brawling Arts: Lv 3, Brawling Mastery: Lv 3, Crisis Sense: Lv 5, Holy Fist Arts: Lv 4, Holy Fist Mastery: Lv 6, Fist Arts: Lv Max, Fist Mastery: Lv Max, Hard Spirit: Lv 8, Hard Power: Lv Max, Instruction: Lv 6, Blink: Lv Max, Blink Step: Lv 3, Status Resistance Lv 5, Mental Resistance: Lv 5, Provocation: Lv 4, Throwing: Lv 4, Dimitris Style Martial Arts: Lv Max, Dimitris Style Mastery: Lv Max, Physical Barrier: Lv 6, Magic Resistance: Lv 6, Magic Perception: Lv 5, Magic Release: Lv 8, Drowsiness Resistance: Lv 5, Orc Killer, Kobold Killer, Gastronomy, Split Thinking, Energy Control</p>
<p>Unique Skills</p>
<p>Energy Outburst, Food Storage</p>
<p>Unique Skills</p>
<p>Magic Cloak Fist</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>Orc Killer, Kobold Killer, Giant Slayer, Heir to the Dimitris School, Bludger, Destroyer of Monsters, Rank A Adventurer</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>Spiral Piercing Knuckles, Tenma Silk Robe, Tenma Silk Garments, Water Dragonbone Wargreaves, Bracelet of Magic Control, Pendant of Regeneration</p>


<p>Her status is strong, but her skills are also great. Since she has max level in the Dimitris Style, she should be able to the use the same moves as Dimitris himself. I'm sure she should be able to use whatever secret arts the style has.</p>

<p>It would be like a higher level version of the Colbert we fought last year in the unsealed state.</p>

<p>『It would be nice to see a few Dimitris-style moves.』</p>
<p>「……No way.」</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>《The probability that the individual name Hiltoria uses Dimitris style martial arts, 2%.》</p>

<p>Not only Fran and Urushi, but even Announce-san! Well, I agree with you.</p>

<p>Hilt's opponent is a large adventurer with an axe. His face is stern and powerful. Walking through town, everyone would give way to him.</p>

<p>However, he is not very strong. Or rather, pretty weak. Their strength is much lower than those of the three Scarlet Maidens.</p>

<p>Since the preliminary matches are completely random, it is possible that a person with a weak ability may be selected for the main tournament if he or she wins a block full of weak players.</p>

<p>The match ended as expected. Hilt's jab, which was thrown as a feint, easily settled the match.</p>

<p>Unable to even react to Hilt's attack, the axeman collapsed in a heap after taking a jab to the jaw. We saw not even a glimpse of Hilt's ability.</p>

<p>『W-well, I'm sure they'll be a better opponent next time, so we'll see what happens then.』</p>
<p>「Nn……」</p>

<p>We continued to watch. I saw a friend of ours at the next match.</p>

<p>「Ladur.」</p>

<p>Fran actually remembered his name, which is a rare occurance. He is an old wizard of Ulmutt, with whom Fran had tea once. He is ranked C, but is as good as B. He was once in a party with Aurel apparently.</p>

<p>I couldn't watch his match last year, but I believe he was defeated by Cruz, who was supposed to be a lower ranked player. He was probably disoriented by his speed and was hit by a big move first.</p>

<p>He was a former court magician, so even though his level of magic was high, his physical status was quite low due to his old age.</p>

<p>How about this year?</p>

<p>I was a little worried while watching the match, but old Ladur was very strong. He said that he could use the 3 attributes of continental, storm, and ocean, and he used them exquisitely.</p>

<p>He did not use powerful magic, but rather a combination of simple spells.</p>

<p>He uses continental magic to break his opponent's foothold, flashy ocean magic to draw his attention, and invisible storm magic to quietly attack.</p>

<p>The enemy shieldman sank helplessly in the face of the variety of magic released without chanting.</p>

<p>『He might not be good with guys like Cruz that focus on speed and aim for big reckless damage, but he is pretty strong against a slow opponent.』</p>
<p>「Ladur is amazing!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>

<p>Fran's eyes were shining. He is not a flashy fighter, but he is a skilled fighter. I guess he is a similar type of player to Mordred, except this one specializes in sorcery.</p>

<p>In the final D block, there were quite a few players whom I know.</p>

<p>First up was Elza. His presence was as strong as ever, and his figure carrying a huge mace was so powerful that a child would have nightmares about it.</p>

<p>He was smiling as he took his opponent's attacks and easily won the match with a few attacks.</p>

<p>Next on stage was Charlotte. She is a girl who specializes in a rather tricky style, fighting with an iron ring in her hand while dancing.</p>

<p>She used the ring to capture her opponent's spear and snatch it away from him, winning the match without hesitation.</p>

<p>Both of them were strong, but the impact of the next person was no less impressive. The mantis-headed half-insectkin Neidhart stood out that much.</p>

<p>Although he was barehanded, he had smashed and destroyed a steel sword. There were screams when he fought back against the sword with his bare hands, but the next moment there were loud cheers.</p>

 
<p>Name: Neidhart Age: 57</p>
<p>Race: Half-Insectkin - Mantis</p>
<p>Occupation: Twin Striker</p>
<p>Status Level: 66/99</p>
<p>HP: 897 MP: 214 STR: 588 VIT: 317 AGI: 612 INT: 138 MAG: 167 DEX: 433</p>
<p>Skills</p>
<p>Bad Eating: Lv 3, Feet Sense: Lv 4, Assassination: Lv 4, Covert: Lv 4, Singing: Lv 3, Observation: Lv 4, Crisis Perception: Lv 8, Archery Arts: Lv 4, Archery Mastery: Lv 6, Critical Detection: Lv 4, Courtly Etiquette: Lv 2, Calculation: Lv 5, Perception: Lv 6, Presence Blocking: Lv 5, Sword Arts: Lv 5, Sword Mastery: Lv 5, Holy Fist Arts: Lv 3, Holy Fist Mastery: Lv 3, Fist Arts: Lv Max, Fist Mastery: Lv Max, Hard Spirit: Lv 4, Negotiation: Lv Max, Hard Power: Lv 3, Command: Lv 7, Instruction: Lv 4, Blink: Lv Max, Blink Walk: Lv 8, Silence Action: Lv 6, Status Resistance: Lv 7, Mental Resistance: Lv 3, Twin Sword Arts: Lv Max, Farseeing: Lv 4, Fatigue Recovery: Lv 6, Magic Resistance: Lv 2, Magic Sense: Lv 3, Night Vision, Strengthen Legs, Leg Boost, Control Energy, Null Pain, Fortitude, Increase Agility</p>
<p>Unique Skills</p>
<p>Idaten</p>
<p>Unique Skill</p>
<p>Sickle Blade, Twin Strike, Bugform</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>Giant Slayer, King of Battlefield, Thousand Slayer, Twin Swordsman, Survivor, Hundred Slayer, Bug Bond</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>Silver Dragon Twin Swords, Silver Dragon Scale Gauntlet, Cerberus Garment, Orihalcon Light Armor, Cerberus Wargreaves, Bracelet of Spirit Recovery, Anklet of Super Life Restoration</p>


<p>They are quite strong. Also, he was much older than the others. I thought he was in his twenties because he sounded like a handsome voice actor. I guess he has been fighting on the battlefield for many years, and that's why he is so strong.</p>

<p>He has some skills that we have not seen yet, and I am looking forward to seeing him in a real fight.</p>

<p>Felmus, the last one on the list, will bring out the best in Neidhart. He is a former rank A adventurer who fought with us last year in the third place match.</p>

<p>His ever-changing strategy using threads really made us suffer. Even now, he uses strings to block his opponent's movements and his fists to settle the match. To the spectators, Felmus' opponents seem to have suddenly stopped moving for no reason.</p>

<p>Last time we managed to win the fight by overpowering him with big moves, but I am not sure if we will win the next time we fight.</p>

<p>Even Fran and Urushi and I have become much stronger since then. No, in the limited space of the arena, we would have a good chance to win.</p>

<p>But if it ever comes to a death battle in an area like a forest, I am honestly not so sure.</p>

<p>『It doesn't look like it will be easy to win again this year……』</p>
<p>「Nn! Bring it on!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『First, we have to beat Mordred!』</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「Arf-」</p>


<p>===== (Author Note)</p>

<p>My cold has gotten worse.</p>
<p>Sorry about that. The next update will be on the 12th.</p>
