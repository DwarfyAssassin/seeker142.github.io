<h2 id="ch718">718: The Devouring Woman</h2>
<p>「Taaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Oruaaaah!」</p>

<p>Fran and Sibylla's sword clash had become even more fierce.</p>

<p>Fran attacks Sibylla without pause, moving at super-high speed with her Brilliant Lightning Rush. Each blow is at full force, slicing through Sibylla's skin and impacting her internal organs.</p>

<p>Sibylla's movements do not seem to slow down at all as she wields her sword, while regenerating countless wounds instantly. On the contrary, her speed continued to rise in response to her excitement.</p>

<p>The audience gasped for breath, forgetting to cheer, as they watched the overly fast slashes that were difficult to even see. They all knew that something great is going on.</p>

<p>But despite the intensity of the battle, neither fighter has sustained any noticeable damage. Our attacks, even if they seem to go in a little deeper, are quickly regenerated.</p>

<p>Once, we succeeded in cutting off a finger of her left hand with a series of slashes to the same area, but it was regenerated instantly. This must be a skill on the level of instant regeneration.</p>

<p>All of Sibylla's attacks were avoided by Fran. In the beginning, I tried to add the physical nullification skill, but it was too much of a drain. Which means Fran has only taken damage from Brilliant Lightning Rush's cost.</p>

<p>That too, is mitigated now with the life magic I learned in the Belioth Kingdom. The damage was not enough to catch up to our recovery.</p>

<p>At first glance, it seems to be a stalemate, but I'd have to say we are at a disadvantage. Whatever unknown ability Sibylla is using to support her defense should also consume a lot of magic, but I can't say for sure.</p>

<p>If it was more fuel-efficient than I had imagined, then the longer the fight dragged on, the worse it would be for us.</p>

<p>I wanted to settle this as soon as possible. And we still have a shot, if we target Sibylla's eyes.</p>

<p>With the divine attribute, our current attack should be able to penetrate the eye. If the attack passes through the eye to the inside of the skull, she'll die no matter how tough she is.</p>

<p>Sibylla, perhaps knowing this, avoids only the attacks to the face.</p>

<p>It seems that Sibylla has an animal-like instinct to detect dangerous attacks.</p>

<p>『I have to stop her movements before we can do anything!』</p>
<p>（Master's thread?）</p>
<p>『She's got too much power. Steel threads may not be enough to hold her.』</p>

<p>When I attempted to block her attack with physical nullification, the magic consumption was too great. It was more than when I blocked Colbert's technique last year. It blocked a single hit out of her barrage of attacks, and that was all I could handle.</p>

<p>Sibylla's magic sword is not so powerful as is it sturdy. In other words, Sibylla's high attack power is the result of her own strength. With such power, it is doubtful how far she can be restrained by my strings.</p>

<p>（Then?）</p>
<p>『Then it's time for a surprise attack.』</p>
<p>（I see.）</p>

<p>Fran folded her arms at her side and pulled back in preparation for a thrust. She purposely made a show of the motion.</p>

<p>Sibylla, who sensed that we were going to perform a big move, smirks confidently. Her attention is completely focused on Fran, just as we intended.</p>

<p>She failed to pay attention to her footing.</p>

<p>『Urushi! Now!』</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Unh!?」</p>

<p>It was a surprise attack by Urushi, who we had in reserve since the start of the battle. Almost zero opponents have perfectly avoided such an attack at first sight.</p>

<p>It was impressive that she managed to react before getting bitten, but still she could not escape from Urushi's jaws, who had appeared right under her feet.</p>

<p>「What the hell is this huge thing!?」</p>

<p>She must have gotten some information about Urushi beforehand, but it was information about Urushi when he shrunk himself.</p>

<p>He has never shown his maximum size in this city, and very few people have seen it in general. Like we thought, she didn't know about it either.</p>

<p>After noticing Urushi's presence, Sibylla jumped backwards but was caught in the jaws of the giant Urushi much to her surprise.</p>

<p>Urushi's head is more than 5 meters long, and Sibylla is caught at the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>Even with Urushi's fangs, she does not seem to be taking damage. However, those powerful jaws have caught both her legs below the knees, and she is unable to move.</p>

<p>「Tch! Hey!」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Roll!」</p>

<p>Sibylla tried to attack Urushi, but Fran was faster. With Black Lightning Roll, she moved in front of Sibylla in an instant, and used that speed to launch a forceful thrust.</p>

<p>「Khwoooooooooooo!」</p>

<p>Sibylla tilts her head just in time so that my tip enters her mouth instead of her eyes. But that's okay.</p>

<p>『I'll just tear you apart from the inside!』</p>

<p>And don't think that's going to be the end of it. Have some deadly poison I pulled out of dimensional storage as a mouthwash! But things didn't go as planned.</p>

<p>「Mgr!」</p>
<p>「!」</p>

<p>Fran's eyes widen in surprise. The same goes for me.</p>

<p>Sibylla bit down on the tip of my blade with her teeth, stopping the thrust. Catching a blade not with your hands, but with your teeth? Her reaction time was astonishingly fast and her jaw strength was also tremendous.</p>

<p>But what really surprised me was what she did after.</p>

<p>Crack! Crack!</p>

<p>『Whoa?』</p>

<p>What the hell? Sibylla bit the tip of my blade off! This isn't a matter of how tough her teeth are. No matter how extraordinary Sibylla is, it should be absolutely impossible for her to bite off my blade when it's enhanced with my mana conductivity.</p>

<p>Reality, however, proved me wrong. My tip is chipped with Sibylla's teeth marks imprinted on it.</p>

<p>Crunch! Crunch! Crack!</p>

<p>And she didn't just bite it off.</p>

<p>「Nom, yummy. Nice sword! Nom, does it have a poison ability on it?」</p>

<p>She was eating all the poison I put in her mouth too.</p>

<p>She chewed up my blade and swallowed it as if she was eating a cracker. And she wasn't putting on an act or anything either.</p>

<p>「Ha ha ha! This magic sword certainly has a unique flavor!」</p>

<p>It was clear to me that Sibylla's magic power increased slightly. Undoubtedly because of how she had eaten me. And she didn't seem to be bothered by the poison that could kill an average human with a single drop.</p>

<p>「You let go of me already!」</p>
<p>「Gya!」</p>

<p>Sibylla took a bite into the tip of Urushi's nose, who was still holding her leg. Then she chews and swallows Urushi's flesh.</p>

<p>「This one is good too! And with a great power! I can taste that concentrated darkness flavor!」</p>

<p>Sibylla exclaimed, her magic power increasing even more than before.</p>

<p>Devouring others, and expanding her own power? She seemed to have an ability for that.</p>

<p>「Want me to finish the meal?」</p>
<p>「Kyuuu……」</p>
<p>『Urushi! Retreat for now!』</p>

<p>Urushi whimpered slightly in fright. He must have been scared of Sibylla who was chewing his flesh in front of his eyes.</p>

<p>I can understand that. The sight of a beautiful woman biting and chewing off the meat of a beast was unusually impactful. Even Fran was taken aback by how Sibylla took a bite out of me and Urushi in succession.</p>

<p>『This is a much more impressive opponent than I imagined……! Eating me and Urushi, what the hell!』</p>
<p>（Master, are you okay?）</p>
<p>『It's regenerated, everything's fine, but…… Oh man, she's insane.』</p>
<p>「Urushi?」</p>
<p>「Kuhn……」</p>

<p>Both Urushi and I have regeneration. The physical damage is not that bad, but the psychological impact is still felt.</p>

<p>『What is her ability……? It can't just be normal eating, right? Does it have anything to do with her defenses?……』</p>
