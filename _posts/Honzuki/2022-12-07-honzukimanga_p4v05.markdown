<h2>Rozemyne's Classes Completed</h2>

I return to my room after the afternoon practical exercises, and my entourage holds a meeting. They report what happened to each other during their lectures before dinner. Meanwhile, I report what happened during my Schtappe practical.

「Wilfried-sama, you mean to say that Rozemyne-sama has finished all her classes?」

「Yes, that's right. After almost two years of sleeping in Jureve, Rozemyne finished the Schtappe practical before anyone else. Right, Gregor?」

I nodded, feeling a little proud of my sister, and asked the guard knight apprentice Gregor for his confirmation. He is an archnoble of the same year as me, so we have practicals in the same classroom.

「While we were struggling to stabilize the structure of our Schtappes, Rozemyne-sama managed to form her Schtappe with ease.」

Stabilizing the Schtappe form is also not easy until you get used to it. The release of mana has to be constant, and if you don't have a clear shape in mind, it will collapse quickly. Rozemyne is unusual in that she stabilized the Schtappe form, and also completed the transformations and mana exercises before I knew it.

「Unless you're really used to working with mana, shouldn't that be incredibly difficult?」

「I think Rozemyne is used to it. She has been dealing with mana in the temple rituals. She also fulfilled the archducal family's obligation to supply to the Foundation Magic without any issue from the beginning.」

I had Mother assisting me with a mana-filled feystone, but Rozemyne was able to supply on her own and make it look easy.

「I can't believe she's slept in Jureve for two years. She seemed so unreliable when she woke up...」

The scholar apprentice Keylant's words reminded me of Rozemyne when she had just woken up from the Jureve. Even before the incident, I had thought her growth to be a little slow, but our eyes were at around the same level. Now Rozemyne's head barely reaches my chest, let alone my shoulders. I am looking down on her completely.

...*It was as if Rozemyne had shrunk.*

Everyone was shocked, but it must have been more of a surprise to Rozemyne. Her darting eyes looking around seemed very anxious. No wonder. There had been a gap of two years. Not only did she appear different from everyone around her, but there was a big hole in her education. She managed to attend the Royal Academy in time, but we expected her to be belittled for her appearance, lack of study, and social skills. I was to be the one assisting and protecting the weakened Rozemyne.

...*But the reality turned out to be very different.*

With the aim of going to the Royal Academy library and Uncle's cramming, which started as soon as she woke up, Rozemyne passed all the lectures one after the other. She even helped me out with the court etiquette classes. She did not need my advice or help at all.

「Rozemyne-sama passes lecture after lecture, but she is still a child on the inside. The problem is that she only has eyes for her library. Very unfitting for an archduke candidate.」

My head attendant, Oswald, lightly pressed his forehead. I can understand how he feels. I had tried to make Rozemyne, who only cared for the library, aware of her status as an archduke candidate. That's why I added the condition for all first-year students passing their exams, but she went off the rails. I was stunned by the spoiled child-like aspect of Rozemyne, because my memories only contained her acting mature.

「But why is Rozemyne-sama so obsessed with libraries in the first place?」

In response to the question of Isidore, my attendant apprentice, I crossed my arms and thought about the subject, to no avail.

「I don't find the library a pleasant place, but perhaps the scholars would understand how Rozemyne feels? Don't you often go to the library?」

「Indeed, us scholars often visit the library. However, it's not a place I'd want to go at all costs, without regard to the inconvenience to others. If there any reference materials I need, I can simply have someone fetch them for me.」

「Keylant is right, I don't share Rozemyne-sama's enthusiasm for the library at all. I also highly doubt the existence of any other who would pray to the gods and spread blessings just because they've been allowed to enter the reading room.」

Ignaz states his agreement with Keylant. The library is no more than a place for storing reference materials. Rozemyne always wants to go to the library no matter what the cost, even going as far to cry and beg in public, then spreading her blessings when she finally enters. It seems she's considered an unusual bookworm, even to the scholar apprentices who are familiar with the library. The words Uncle once said, "If you put a pile of books in front of her, she will study on her own", were indeed true.

「Her sheer enthusiasm was astonishing once she was allowed into the Royal Academy library. At least now Rozemyne shouldn't cause trouble for a while.」

「Perhaps not to us, but her daily visits to the library are a nuisance to her own entourage. I feel sorry for those retainers being dragged around by her all the time.」

「Is that so?」

I blinked in surprise at Isidore's unexpected words. Alexis, my guard knight apprentice, told me about the movements of an archduke candidate. Unlike other students, we archduke candidates must be accompanied by our entourage wherever we go. If one heads outside, they should be accompanied by at least three members of their entourage.

「Setting aside their adult attendant, which is Oswald in our case, the rest of the entourage at the Royal Academy have their own lectures to attend. Those few who have completed their lectures and are available can coordinate their schedules, but that's difficult this early. They might be able to make time for an occasional event, but if it's every day...」

「I see. So finishing your lectures as quickly as possible is not always the best?」

「As long as she doesn't leave the dormitory, finishing her lectures early will not be a burden to her entourage.」

Isidore smiles at me, his meaning clearly being, "The daily visits to the library are the problem." Ercult, one of my guard knight apprentices, nodded his head and told me how Rozemyne's guard knight apprentices had also complained.

「We sometimes talk among guard knight apprentices, and Traugott-sama lamented this fact. Rozemyne-sama's entourage had to rush to finish their lectures in order to accompany her to the library, making it really hard for them to find time for their own research and knight training.」

It would indeed be a problem if they couldn't do their own research or training. I raised my eyebrows.

「Wouldn't it be better to pass that complaint on to Rozemyne? If her entourage is in trouble, I'm sure she'll cut down a bit on the library visits...」

In my mind, Rozemyne is a child, but as smart and responsible as an adult. If told about a problem in the temple or the commoners in the printing business, she would fix it immediately. So if she learns about her actions affecting the work of her entourage, I have no doubt she would do the same thing. That's what I suggested, but the others had a completely different opinion.

「Are you saying Rozemyne-sama, who has kept her promise to Ferdinand-sama and completed all her lectures, that she should refrain from going to the library every day?」

「Please remember the incident with the performance improvement committee. You will be scolded by Ferdinand-sama again.」

「The library can become both poison and medicine, was it? I think this time it's clearly going to be poison.」

For those who joined my entourage after Rozemyne fell asleep in Jureve, the sight of Rozemyne burdening the first-years must have left an intense impression. With everyone telling me to stop, I backed down.

「If it truly becomes impossible, her aides will speak out themselves, and Rihyarda will scold her if she refuses to listen. That is what her head attendant is here for. It might become more troublesome if Wilfried-sama were to bring the subject up.」

Oswald's words convinced me. Even well-meaning words can be superfluous. I don't want to be scolded by Uncle again either.

「As the head attendant, I hope that Wilfried-sama will take a lesson from Rozemyne-sama's behavior. Please do not forget to take the lectures and schedules of your entourage into account.」

「Yes, I will try to keep that in mind as much as possible. Do not hesitate to tell me if you have any concerns.」

My nodding at Oswald's words brought a look of relief to the entourage.

「We are really glad to have Wilfried-sama as a master who listens to us.」

「I can really appreciate this when comparing it to Rozemyne-sama's entourage.」

...*They're complimenting me.*

I was embarrassed by the words of my aides. I think this is the first time I have been praised in comparison to Rozemyne. Before her Jureve, she kept saving me and I lost at everything I did. I was technically superior to Rozemyne in terms of physical strength, but Rozemyne was so weak that even my 2-3 year old brother could probably overpower her back then. That's not an area where I can really feel happy about victory. In fact, I felt even more powerless always losing to someone so frail.

...*I'm a good master for listening well to my aides?*

I never thought I would be praised in comparison to Rozemyne. I must resolve myself to develop these virtues further.

「Let's not worry about Rozemyne-sama right now. Wilfried-sama, please take your time on the lectures.」

「But isn't it best to pass quickly with good grades?」

The archduke candidates and archnobles from the other domains have praised Rozemyne for finishing her lectures one after the other. I've also received envious stares upon finishing my mana handling and court etiquette practicals early. Though I will not annoy my entourage by going out every day like Rozemyne, I still want to finish the lectures as quickly as I can.

But Oswald shakes his head, saying, "We can't put things that simply."

「It's true that Rozemyne-sama is impressive for passing her classes so quickly. There's no doubt about that. But the Royal Academy is the place where you can meet nobles from other domains. If you leave the lectures early, you will have less time to get to know them.」

I remember back to the lectures. In the classroom, each duchy had their own assigned seating, making it very difficult to interact with the other duchies. In the practicals, some subjects did not have assigned seating. Still, the students grouped together with those from the same duchy, so there was no interaction. I turned to Gregor, who attended the classes with me.

「Can we really interact with other duchies during our classes?」

「I'm not sure about that. Weren't all the duchies grouped along by themselves?」

「You two are still first-year students, and your time at the Royal Academy has only just begun. As the school year goes on, everyone will begin interacting more with other duchies.」

Apparently, more importance is placed on interaction with those we only see in winter, rather than those we can always meet back at the dormitories. There are few opportunities to obtain information about the other duchies, and it is said that those with many connections have an advantage when finding a marriage partner.

「The first-year students are still getting used to the lectures and are wary of their surroundings. But in ten days or so, everyone will start opening up a little more. The events of the lectures will often come up as topics of conversation. You will be at a disadvantage if you can't get into the topic then.」

「The interactions you have at Royal Academy will serve as great experience for the Archduke Conferences. If you are going to be the next Archduke, you need to get to know as many people as possible, as well as learn how to exchange information and interact.」

「Rozemyne-sama only has her eyes on the library. It seems there is no room for interaction with other territories. The next archduke can't afford to be like that. The social side will become a problem for her entourage too.」

I nod repeatedly as I listen to the opinions of each member of my entourage. It seems working on my social skills will give me another area I can beat Rozemyne.

「I suppose I should talk to the other territories during the next practical session. If I pick out an archnoble, it will not be a problem if I make a few mistakes, correct?」

Before entering the Royal Academy, I've received many warnings about the danger of making a mistake in front of an archduke candidate from a greater duchy. Meanwhile, a mistake in front of an archnoble shouldn't be a big issue since I hold the higher position. However, Keylant gave me a frown when I spoke my thoughts.

「Wilfried-sama, you are an archduke candidate and therefore higher than an archnoble from a greater duchy. Still, be careful not to be too arrogant towards them.」

「Why?」

「Because archnobles are often members of someone's entourages, or relatives to the archducal family. Would you want to be friendly if an archduke candidate from a lesser ranked duchy behaves rudely towards a member of your entourage?」

I look around at the faces of my entourage and imagine them being poorly treated. How could I act friendly to someone who has wronged one of them?

「...I certainly wouldn't feel like being friendly.」

「That is exactly why you must also handle entourage members and archnobles from a greater duchy with the utmost care.」

「Saying something on the spur of the moment may result in trouble later. It's a good idea to brainstorm what you say beforehand.」

Keylant and Isidore's words made me involuntarily turn to face Gregor.

「Socializing seems harder than I thought it would be. Now I'm hesitant to speak to those from other duchies.」

「I would like to have some sort of guidelines on what to talk about. Like the most common topics that come up, and how to deal with them...」

At Gregor's words, Ignaz clapped his hands.

「What if we have Wilfried-sama suggest this as the agenda at the dinner table? This year's trends will not be the same as they have been in the past. Hearing everyone's opinions on the subject would be helpful to me as well.」

「Since Rozemyne-sama's lectures are over, perhaps we can throw her the subject of socialization. That might divert her attention from the library. Wouldn't that also be less offensive than directly telling her to go to the library less often?」

I nodded at Oswald's suggestion and decided to talk about socializing at the dinner table.
