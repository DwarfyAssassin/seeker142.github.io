<h2>My Sister, Vanished and Returned</h2>

「Cornelius, let the knights of Dunkelfelger who have joined us take care of the enemy, and we will go to guard our master.」

Leonore said, indicating Rozemyne on the altar. With a Waschen that seemed to wash over the entire auditorium, we were separated from Rozemyne, our master. I want to join her as soon as possible. Nodding to Leonore's suggestion, we both rode our highbeasts down to the spectator seats.

However, as we were running toward the altar, something unusual happened. Rozemyne's wind shield, Ferdinand-sama's mana attack, and Gervasio's mana attack. As if in response to the mana of the three, a pillar of light shot out from the statues' divine instruments.

「What!」

「Kya! It's so bright!」

The light was so strong that I held my hand holding the cloak in front of my face and closed my eyes. When the light disappeared, the three of them were not on the altar, and I looked at Leonore in shock.

「Gone…? Where did they go?」

「This is beyond our control. Let's get back to the others for now. We can't risk them shooting at us here.」

I nodded at Leonore's pragmatic decision. Prince Anastasius is heading for the altar at Highbeast, blocked by an invisible wall and targeted by the silver-cloaked men. The prince's guard knights and the knights of Dunkelfelger are struggling to protect him.  Looking down from the spectator seats, we can see the Dunkelfelger knights capturing the men of the Central Order one after another. Matthias and Laurenz seem to be helping them. We strengthened ourselves and searched below to see if we could use Highbeast to get down.

「…The enemy looks strange…」

「Ah. They seem to have suddenly lost momentum.」

The enemy, who had been attacking us with great vigor, suddenly lost its will to fight for some reason. I saw a number of knights who were puzzled as if they did not know what was going on.

「The hostility is still strong among the knights who wear silver cloaks. Those with black cloaks, even if they are enemies, seem to be meekly captured by the knights of Dunkelfelger.」

「Yes. Let's join Matthias and Laurenz and help them capture the knights. We don't want the Dunkelfelger knights who came later to say that the Ehrenfest knights did nothing, do we?」

「Ah, now that all eyes are on the royalty, we can get off at Highbeast.」

Prince Anastasius is in front of the altar, and Magdalena-sama and Aub Dunkelfelger are in the center of the auditorium in front of the dedication dance stage. There, the knights are distracted by the sight of Magdalena-sama and Aub Dunkelfelger hunting down the Central Knight Commander.

Leonore and I went down by Highbeast and joined Matthias and the others to help them capture the enemy. Unlike before, we outnumbered them. No matter how many silver weapons and armor the enemy has, someone can exploit an opening and attack them before they can use them. We can hunt them down without allowing them to recover.

Some of them even come to get captured themselves. It was not so difficult to catch them all.

「Leave them to Dunkelfelger and rest. Only a knight of Dunkelfelger who has permission to enter and leave can take prisoners to the palace.」

Grateful for Heisshitze-sama's kindness, the knights of Ehrenfest and Ahrensbach take a rest.

「Are the restoratives safe?」

I asked Hartmut and Clarissa who were waiting near the entrance of the auditorium.

「Yes, I held onto them during the Waschen. Make sure you send the words of praise to Rozemyne-sama.」

Hartmut smiled and offered me a restorative medicine. I was impressed by the fact that he had managed to keep them in the water, but I knew not to say anything complimentary. I took it without saying a word. Then I swallowed a small pill along with a recovery potion. This is the kind of ration I use when I am short on time, and it provides me with some sustenance for the time being. Then Eckhart and Justus-sama also came in for some restorative pills.

「Can you give us some too?」

「There won't be enough for the knights of Ahrensbach……」

「They are gathered over there, so don't worry about them.」

Ahrensbach's cloaks are gathering in the direction Justus-sama points. They are supposed to be our allies for the time being, but now that we have captured our common enemy and our masters Rozemyne and Ferdinand-sama are gone, we can't help but be cautious. It is more comfortable to keep this much distance.

「And where the hell is Ferdinand-sama anyway?」

「Eckhart, don't be so irritated. If you've given your name to the Lord, you know he's safe, don't you?」

Eckhart looked around at us and frowned.

「You look so unperturbed by the disappearance of your master. You must be slacking.」

「This is the second time Rozemyne has suddenly disappeared before our eyes, and there is nothing we can do about it. As long as Hartmut is keeping a cool head, I don't think there is any problem.」

But that was as far as I could go. Suddenly, with "Ugh?" "Hhh?" and a groan of pain, Hartmut, Clarissa, Matthias, and Laurenz collapsed on the spot.

「What's going on!」

Said Eckhart and Justus-sama, but nothing changed for them. Only those who had dedicated their names to Rozemyne were crouched on the floor with frowns on their faces, as if they were in pain.

Hartmut, kneeling on the floor, breathing hard and shaking, begins to weep. Hartmut is particularly sensitive to the fluctuations in Rozemyne's mana among his entourage. Every day after she disappeared in the Royal Academy library, "Rozemyne-sama is growing. It's wonderful," he enthused, but he never shed a tear.

「What's wrong! What happened to Rozemyne!」

*……No way.*

I had a bad feeling. It is said that those who offer their names will share life with the Lord. Something must have happened to Rozemyne beyond our control.

Just thinking about it made me feel as if I were being choked, and I asked Hartmut, who was still crouching.

「Hartmut, is Rozemyne safe?」

「Ah, Mestionora, the Goddess of Wisdom, whose every color has been repainted at the entreaty of Geduldh, the Goddess of Earth, who could not bear Ewigeliebe, the God of Life. She has been bestowed the loving-kindness of the Supreme Gods, the Gods of Darkness and Light. Her hair is like the night sky of the God of Darkness, and her eyes pierce the night as if belonging from the Goddess of Light. The power of the gods pervades every nook and cranny, and I have truly learned the depths of their favor.」

「What? This… this can't be…」

Clarissa seemed to understand the words, even though I didn't understand them at all. Her blue eyes lit up and for some reason even Clarissa started to cry. I have a bad feeling about this. While the rest of us around us are stunned, Hartmut and Clarissa both stand up and start praising the gods and Rozemyne.

The pain of the entourage seemed to last only about thirty seconds, and Matthias and Laurenz slowly stood up as well.

They said things such as "It hurts" or "I'm surprised", but no one seems to be in critical condition. I gave up questioning the praying Hartmut and Clarissa.

「Matthias, Laurenz, what are these two saying?」

「…I could see that Rozemyne-sama's mana that binds me has changed a lot, like she is a different person, but I can't say much more than that…」

「Cornelius, please don't lump us in with these two, will you?」

I don't understand what is happening to Rozemyne, but it doesn't sound like there is any imminent danger. I let out a sigh of relief when I hear Angelica's bouncing voice behind me, "Well done!" I turned around to see Magdalena-sama with a dagger in the flank of the leader of the Central Order and Aub Dunkelfelger with a sword in his shoulder.

*……The battle is won.*

Someone quickly tied Hartmut up with a band of light and rolled him into the corner of the auditorium. Everyone looks at Leonore in surprise, and she warns them in a whisper.

「Magdalena-sama is paying attention to us. We don't want her to take Hartmut's words the wrong way, as that could hinder future negotiations regarding Rozemyne.」

At that moment, Hartmut and Clarissa became quiet. 

「……We will have to report to Ferdinand-sama that the Dunkelfelger knights took silver weapons from the palace. They had them since before entering the auditorium, yes?」[^1]

Leonore calmly pointed out the silver weapon impaling Raublut. All the dangerous silver weapons and tools brought in from Lanzenave should have been gathered in a corner of the Adalgisa Palace. Some of us were given silver weapons for the upcoming battle, but only under Ferdinand-sama's watchful eye. They were to be returned after the battle's end.

The same could not be said for Aub Dunkelfelger, who had already left before we finished organizing the weapons. Therefore, he must have obtained those weapons without Ferdinand-sama's knowledge. Since he and his men had dived immediately at Raublut upon entering the auditorium, they could not have obtained them from the enemy side during the battle.

Isn't my fiance too good? Simply wonderful.

<br>

With Raublut captured, the battle was over. The atmosphere in the auditorium suddenly relaxes, and Prince Anastasius demands that his guard knights, who had been tied up from all sides by the Dunkelfelger knights, be released. Magdalena-sama is arranging to take the prisoners to the palace.

「What do we do now?」

Strahl comes to ask for instructions. Normally, we, the new Aub's entourage, should give instructions, but we do not know what to say to the knights of Ahrensbach, with whom we have little contact. When I looked at Eckhart to ask his opinion, Brother stepped in front of me to give instructions to Strahl.

「Ahrensbach's knights will return to the detached palace in shifts, leaving one group behind, and rest to confirm the testimonies we have extracted from the prisoners of war. We will wait for Ferdinand-sama's return while watching the royal family and Dunkelfelger in the auditorium.」

「The return of Ferdinand-sama? What about Rozemyne-sama……?」

I interrupted Strahl, saying, "It is our job to wait for Rozemyne-sama." There was no way Eckhart cared about anyone but Ferdinand-sama.

「Okay. My team will stay behind and send the rest back to the villa to rest.」

As Strahl goes to instruct the Ahrensbach knights, I look around the auditorium. It is already light in the auditorium, even though it was midnight when I arrived here. I feel uncomfortable in spite of the familiarity of the place, perhaps because the auditorium is designed for a graduation ceremony.

「Shouldn't the auditorium be restored to its original state?」

「We don't want to make it difficult for Ferdinand-sama to return. Keep quiet until the royal family finds out.」

「It's not good that we don't know when they're coming back. When the princess disappeared before, how long did it take her to return?」

While they were talking, white birds flew in one after another. Aub Dunkelfelger, Prince Anastasius, a white bird that landed on Brother Eckhart's arm, starts talking in Ferdinand-sama's voice.

「Eckhart, it's Ferdinand. Help Prince Anastasius with his supplies. Then assemble Rozemyne's entourage in the auditorium.」

「Cornelius, did you hear it? You stay here!」

Eckhart's grim face changes when he sees that the Lord is safe. He went to Prince Anastasius with the box which Hartmut and the others had kept. Justus-sama left the auditorium quickly to greet Ferdinand-sama.

「I don't know exactly what is going on, but I have orders from the goddess of wisdom! Do not take the prisoners' lives! Contact the royal palace and the detached palace immediately!」

Aub Dunkelfelger's voice echoed through the auditorium. Strahl sends Ordonnanz to Adalgisa's detached palace, and the men of the Central Order send Ordonnanz to the royal palace. The atmosphere, which had been relaxed after the battle, immediately became tense.

「Ferdinand-sama!」

We, who had been waiting near the door, ran to Ferdinand-sama as he entered the auditorium. Ferdinand-sama was the only one who returned, and Rozemyne was nowhere to be seen.

「Where is Rozemyne-sama?」

「She has not returned yet. Mestionora, the goddess of wisdom, has descended in order to speak with us about the selection of a new Zent. Now we are moving according to her words.」

「So the goddess has really descended.」

Leonore mutters in surprise and looks at Hartmut, who is bound with a band of light and bouncing around like an aquatic creature washed up on land. Ferdinand-sama looked at him too. After a moment of silence, they look back at each other as if nothing had happened.

「How should we move?」

Leonore did not mention the coming of the goddess, the selection of a new Zent, or the current Rozemyne, but asked about the future course of action. Wait a minute, we can't drop this subject. I still have no idea what is happening to Rozemyne.

「Ferdinand-sama, what do you mean the goddess descended on Rozemyne-sama? Where did it happen?」

「I'm not going to go into details here because we don't have time. Repeat your orders after me. The guard knights are to prepare a silver cloth to hide the returned Rozemyne and wait in front of the door of the room with the teleportation circle.」

By making us repeat our orders, Ferdinand-sama forcibly silenced us.

「Rozemyne is filled with the power of the goddess. It shines from within and is intimidating and hard to approach. It is better not to show the current Rozemyne to others because it will cause trouble.」

Laurenz, who had been entangled with Hartmut, raised his eyebrows and muttered quietly.

「…I don't believe it very much, but…」

「I don't care if you believe me or not. You'll know it when you see it.」

Saying this, Ferdinand-sama glanced at the Dunkelfelger knights who were listening to our conversation. I could tell from his gesture that he did not want to give them any more information, and that he did not want to answer our questions.

「Do not use the transfer door to the dormitory, but take the Highbeast to the Ehrenfest dormitory without being seen by others. After that, let Ehrenfest take care of our logistics. Clarissa will be in charge of preparing Rozemyne's medicine.」

Ferdinand-sama gives Clarissa two medicines and gives her some instructions on how to administer them. Clarissa gives Hartmut a concerned look.

「Are you sure you want me to take care of Rozemyne-sama's medicine?」

「Hartmut is going with us to the Central Temple.」

「Ferdinand-sama, Rozemyne-sama's medicine is my job.」

Hartmut retorts in desperation, bouncing around on the floor. But Ferdinand-sama completely ignored his noisy voice and glanced over the guard knights.

「The prisoners in the palace will be taken care of by the knights of Ahrensbach, so when Rozemyne returns, you should take a rest too. After Rozemyne's recovery, we will have a meeting with the royal family. Ask the servants how long it will take to prepare the costumes and decorations. When Rozemyne is recovered and able to move, have her practice the dedicatory dance. It will be necessary for the rituals she will perform as an incarnation of Mestionora, the goddess of wisdom.」

Then Hartmut's voice stopped and his orange eyes flashed.

「She will perform a dedication dance as the incarnation of Mestionora? Clarissa, prepare the medicine for Rozemyne-sama. I must accompany Ferdinand-sama to the Central Temple to negotiate the rituals.」

It is natural that Hartmut, who does not want to give the Central Temple control over the ritual, gives priority to the preparation of the ritual over the preparation of the medicine. Hartmut, who became quiet when Ferdinand-sama made it clear that he would comply, was soon released.

*……Everything was as Ferdinand-sama wanted it.*

「That's all. Go.」

Ferdinand-sama waved his hand lightly and headed toward Aub Dunkelger and Magdalena-sama. Hartmut runs to his companions who are preparing for battle. I turn to those who are still here.

「We divide up the roles. Laurenz and I will stay in front of the teleportation room in case Rozemyne returns before the silver cloth arrives. Angelica and Matthias are to secure enough silver cloths to hide Rozemyne before we arrive. Leonore will go with Clarissa to the dormitories to make sure everything is ready for rest.」

There was no mention of resting in the Ehrenfest dormitory before going into battle. I would have to check if it was really okay to take Rozemyne with me. Leonore nodded "Okay" at my words and asked me to stay in the auditorium.

「Can I ask Cornelius, who can strengthen his body, to gather information and act as a liaison? At least until Ferdinand-sama and the others departed.」

I accepted the task. With enhanced eyesight and hearing, I can watch Ferdinand-sama and listen carefully to what information is exchanged with Dunkelfelger.

But Ferdinand-sama is as secretive as ever and does not give out much information. The only information he gave was about threatening Magdalena-sama over Prince Hildebrand's acquisition of Schtappe in order to force her to do what he wanted. After giving instructions to each of them, Ferdinand-sama leads Hartmut and Prince Anastasius out of the auditorium. After seeing them off, I also left the auditorium.

<br>

「Cornelius, is this enough cloth?」

「It should be enough. Leonore, how was the dormitory?」

「Justus-sama arrived first. Rihyarda and the others are preparing your rooms. Clarissa immediately went to the mixing room.」

The guard knights gather in front of the teleportation circle room leading to the Country Gate, but Rozemyne does not return after two and a half bells. After waiting for a while, a letter with a magic tool flew in. In Rozemyne's handwriting it says: "I am back".

「Matthias, Laurenz, secure the passage to the north door. Angelica, Leonore, get the cloths ready.」

「Ha!」

After making sure each of them is ready, I tell Rozemyne: "I'm at the door. I'm taking the Highbeast back to the dormitory, so I want you to hold your mouth and come out quietly."

The door opens with a small click. The windowless teleportation circle room is faintly bright. The light source was Rozemyne.

A bang! Angelica immediately covers the room with a cloth. However, her feet, which are not covered by the cloth, emit a faint light. When Angelica picks her up, Leonore covers her feet with a silver cloth too.

Rozemyne is suddenly wrapped in the cloth and lifted up, and I can see that she has taken a small gasp of surprise. But since we are told not to show her around, there is no time for a detailed explanation. Besides, we have not been given a detailed explanation, so we cannot answer any questions.

We run as fast as we can, pretending not to notice Rozemyne's surprise. We run out of the central building at full speed and ride our highbeasts towards the Ehrenfest dormitory.

<br>

「I'm sorry, Rozemyne-sama.」

Arriving at the dormitory, Leonore apologizes and removes the silver cloth. The appearance of Rozemyne dazzles us. Ferdinand-sama had told us beforehand, but to be honest, we did not expect to be as surprised as the last growth. In fact, neither Rozemyne's face shape nor her height has changed.

However, the intimidating and divine light was coming out from inside of her body, and Rozemyne was talking less than usual probably because of her tiredness and poor physical condition, and her facial expression did not change at all. She looked like a different person. I had thought that I could not trust the coming of the goddess, but seeing her like this, I could not doubt her power. I feel like distancing myself from her, since I don't deserve to be this close.

*……No, I'm her brother.*

When Rozemyne grew rapidly, she forced me to pat her head as if she did not want me to keep my distance. I'm not going to let her give me that look twice.

「…Cornelius, Leonore, Matthias, Laurenz?」

I gasped when she called my name. Rozemyne had said something, but I hadn't heard it.

「Oh, no. I mean, I don't know what to say…」

「What is it, Brother Cornelius?」

「It's the power of the Goddess. Ferdinand-sama gave us strict orders to take you to the dormitory in secret, hidden in the silver cloth he confiscated from Lanzenave.」

I feel the power of the goddess so much that I have difficulty making eye contact with her, but apparently Rozemyne is unaware of it. She only tilted her head slightly in wonder.

「Well, may I put this cloth back on and let Angelica carry you to your room so as not to confuse the others?」

Rozemyne accepted Leonore's offer, but she like me tended to look away as well. After getting wrapped in a silver cloth again, Angelica carried her in her arms.

「Well, please rest at ease.」

We stayed on the second floor and watched Rozemyne and the others go up to the third floor. When Rozemyne and the others were completely out of sight, we started walking to our assigned rooms.

「Wow, the power of the Goddess is amazing.」

Laurenz exhaled in awe. I nodded my head in agreement. I never thought my sister could be so divine.

「Anyone would have called her a goddess incarnate after seeing that, not just Hartmut. I'm too much in awe to approach her, but what about the namesworns bound by the power of the goddess?」

Rozemyne's mana changed in the middle of the passage, probably because the goddess descended and her power overflowed. Since they were bound by the power of the goddess, it seems to me that the the namesworned aides would be able to resist that power.

I could ask Hartmut, but I am sure he would not give me a satisfactory answer. I decided to ask the two decent people for an answer instead.

Laurenz, who had been thinking for a while, shakes his dark green head from side to side and turns his orange eyes to me. His face is mysterious instead of his usual smile.

「I don't think she's difficult to approach. It just makes me want to kneel down, or at least inspire loyalty.」

「Wait. Don't say the latter part with a serious face.」

Laurenz usually makes light of everything, but when he makes a serious face, the seriousness of the situation is highlighted. Not knowing whether he was joking or serious, I looked at Matthias, who was usually serious. Matthias nodded his head with his usual face and blue eyes straight at me.

「I can indeed feel a divine aura coming from her. At the same time, I feel proud to offer my name and to serve with all I have. I'm certain to accomplish whatever she commands of me.」

「Calm down! Both of you are talking like Hartmut.」

I did not expect such words from Matthias. I compared him to Hartmut to make him come to his senses, but for some reason Matthias nodded his head again and again with a serious look on his face.

「You mean that Hartmut always felt this way about Rozemyne-sama?」

「I don't like it, but I understand now. Now I can pray to Rozemyne-sama too.」

「Stop it!」

I desperately try to stop them from praying. I had a horrible feeling that the whole entourage would turn into Hartmuts. My face grimaced at the frightening prospect.
