<h2 id="ch720">720: Sibylla Battle Ends</h2>

<p>（Master. Let's go）</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>

<p>Fran readies my blade, clad in the power of the chaos killer, and rushes towards Sibylla.</p>

<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Come on!」</p>

<p>She feinted a blow to the legs and then changed in mid-trajectory, aiming at Sibylla's head like a kendo master slashing at the face mask.</p>

<p>The speed and sharpness of the blow are the same as before. But the sword she is holding is completely different.</p>

<p>I am radiating a vicious power drawn from the blessing.</p>

<p>My blade dives straight into Sibylla's head and… misses.</p>

<p>「Tchi!」</p>

<p>Sibylla twisted herself around in a desperate attempt to avoid me. This is the person who had never tried to take any significant evasive action until now.</p>

<p>As a result, my sword blade slammed into Sibylla's left shoulder.</p>

<p>A little while ago, it would have caused a shallow cut and that would have been the end of it.</p>

<p>But that was not the case this time.</p>

<p>「Impossible!」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>

<p>Sibylla's left arm flies through the air and blood spurts from the wound. It is the biggest damage we've dealt the entire match.</p>

<p>The lost arm slowly begins to regenerate from the shoulder. However, unlike before, the speed of regeneration is clearly slow.</p>

<p>「What the…… That sword?!」</p>
<p>『Keep up the pressure!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Tah!」</p>
<p>「Damn!」</p>

<p>For the first time since the match began, Sibylla is on the run. Her movements were truly animalistic, as she abandoned her attacks and concentrated on evasion.</p>

<p>The attacks that we thought would hit were avoided by a hair's length. Sibylla did not seem to feel any pain, since her movements did not show any sign of slowing down even as the damage accumulated.</p>

<p>Even so, it was impossible to avoid all the attacks of Fran and I, who were going at full power.</p>

<p>「Shhh!」</p>
<p>「Wha? Teleportation!」</p>

<p>I used the teleportation I had been holding back up to this point, and piled up damage by taking advantage of Sibylla's surprise. The number of non-regenerating wounds was increasing, even if we could not deal a one-hit-kill.</p>

<p>『How about this one!』</p>
<p>「Even the magic is strange……!」</p>

<p>I unleash a lightning magic, with the image of applying the blessing of the Chaos Goddess. It doesn't do much damage, but the spell isn't completely nullified either.</p>

<p>Sibylla's movement is momentarily blocked, and Fran's slash cuts through her.</p>

<p>Can we push through like this? Just after that thought passed through my head, Fran took a big leap backwards.</p>

<p>「Urrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>

<p>Sibylla's whole body is overflowing with red magic power. No, not just that. Blood was gushing out alongside with the magic power.</p>

<p>The mixture of red blood and red magic power emits an intense red glow.</p>

<p>The sight of the red liquid dancing around Sibylla is somewhat enchanting. However, despite its beauty, I felt a sense of danger like no other.</p>

<p>The blood was not the only thing strange, Sibylla's own appearance had transformed. All the muscles in her body have grown a size larger, and her teeth and nails have visibly lengthened into fangs and claws. Her eyes have also changed to resemble those of a reptile.</p>

<p>It was similar to the half-dragonkin I had seen before. Could it be that she was not a pure blooded human?</p>

<p>Whatever the case, it looks bad.</p>

<p>「Devour her!」</p>

<p>Sibylla shouted, and the writhing blood swirled like a creature and attacked Fran. It was moving like an amoeba with a mind of its own.</p>

<p>We absolutely cannot let that touch us.</p>

<p>『Fran! Don't let it hit you!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>

<p>After dodging it, Sibylla's blood hits the arena. The area hit was melted away as if it had been eaten by a slime.</p>

<p>Does Sibylla's blood really have such a property?</p>

<p>Fran slashes away at the blood, which is now extended like a whip chasing after her. As expected, it wasn't enough to melt me, since I was clad in the divine attribute.</p>

<p>However, my durability was considerably reduced. We would be in trouble if we continue to take these attacks.</p>

<p>I thought we had pulled off a victory, but I didn't know that she had a trick like this up her sleeve! She's good!</p>

<p>『Fran, let's decide it immediately. Our resources are looking bad if we have to deal with these unknown attacks.』</p>
<p>（Got it.）</p>

<p>Fran nodded and lifted me up in the air. I used Dimension Shift and Physical Nullification to buy Fran time to prepare.</p>

<p>Then Sibylla's attacks stopped immediately. It wasn't that she gave up, since she gathered the blood she had been manipulating and set it up around herself like a barrier.</p>

<p>She must have sensed that Fran was about to decide the match, and planned to block it and dish out a counter attack.</p>

<p>「……」</p>
<p>「……」</p>

<p>Both Fran and Sibylla look at each other without a word. The audience also watches them with bated breath. They must have understood from the tension between the two that the end was approaching.</p>

<p>In the strange silence, Fran and I moved. She lightly crouches down to make it look like she is going to rush in. But this is a bait.</p>

<p>（Master!）</p>
<p>『I'm on it!』</p>

<p>I used illusion magic. The effect is to remotely generate a faint sound. That's all.</p>

<p>It's a poor feint that can hardly be called a technique, and is not even close to Diaz's abilities.</p>

<p>But it's the first time I've shown illusion magic in this match, so Sibylla reacted slightly to it. Seizing the opportunity, we teleported.</p>

<p>We take Sibylla's rear, but she is looking right back at us. She must have read us, since she is not panicking at the slight delay caused by the illusion magic.</p>

<p>I saw the red blood around us, controlled by Sibylla, rushing toward Fran.</p>

<p>But this was just another feint.</p>

<p>「Black Lightning Roll!」</p>
<p>「!」</p>

<p>Though we first teleported behind Sibylla, the actual plan was to move above her head with Black Lightning Roll. This time, we succeeded in completely delaying Sibylla's reaction.</p>

<p>Still, Sibylla tries to increase the thickness of her defense by concentrating her blood above her head. But we were faster.</p>

<p>「Taaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Doryaaaah!』</p>

<p>This time, Fran's Heavenly Judgment sliced Sibylla's body cleanly in two. The head was just barely avoided, but my blade entered the left shoulder, cut through the heart, and passed down through the groin.</p>

<p>「Gah……」</p>

<p>Sibylla lost control of her blood, which falls to the arena with a splash. A split second later, Sibylla fell to the ground in a pool of her blood.</p>

<p>Victory? But neither Fran nor I dropped our combat stance. The cradle of time did not activate. In other words, Sibylla was still alive, even in that condition.</p>

<p>「Ah…… Gah……」</p>

<p>I could see that Sibylla was trying to do something. Her left arm, which should have been separated from her head, is lifted. It seems that she is using her blood as a catalyst to control it.</p>

<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>

<p>Fran and I aimed at her to release a spell.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sibylla's left palm is gathering magic power…</p>

<p>「Tch!」</p>

<p>But Sibylla suddenly stopped moving. Her appearance returned to that of a normal human being, and she muttered in frustration.</p>

<p>「I've… lost……」</p>

<p>Immediately after, the cradle of time was activated and Sibylla's body was enveloped in light.</p>
