<h2 id="ch712">712: Biscot Battle Begins</h2>
<p>Fran is on her merry way to the venue this morning. Her hands equipped with roasted meat skewers from a food stall, as just like every other morning.</p>

<p>Of course she ate breakfast at the inn, or rather, she took some stuff out of her dimensional storage and ate it when she got up from bed. What does it matter? To Fran, a grilled skewer was like a cookie to an ordinary person.</p>

<p>「Munch!」</p>
<p>「Nom nom.」</p>

<p>Urushi meanwhile, was chomping on a huge cow bone taken after broth had been made with it. The lady at the soup stall gave it to us.</p>

<p>He seemed to enjoy biting the middle of the bone which was more than a metre long.</p>

<p>Reminds me of a silly-looking dog walking with a long wooden stick in its mouth.</p>

NOTE: CONTINUE HERE

<p>Yesterday, I heard that the number of customers had increased after Fran praised them, and she even got some free bowls of soup for it. Those disappeared into Fran and Urushi's bellies in an instant.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure there was some stuff you needed to chew in there though.</p>

<p>「Mogu…… Mwah!」</p>
<p>『What's wrong, Fran?』</p>
<p>「That…」</p>

<p>Fran stopped suddenly and saw a familiar man standing in front of her.</p>

<p>「That one guy from that country…」</p>
<p>『Viscount Emmert of the Kingdom of Shallus. Well, not that you need to remember.』</p>
<p>「What do we do?」</p>
<p>『Hmm.』</p>

<p>He's obviously waiting for someone. It's very likely that it's Fran.</p>

<p>Actually, we had a chance to talk to Kaitly a little bit yesterday. I remember what she said.</p>

<br>
<p>「Shallus Kingdom? They came to me too.」</p>
<p>「Oh, yes! I heard that the people are causing a lot of trouble and that Grandfather is very busy. He said he's going to send a letter of protest to the Shallus Kingdom.」</p>

<p>A letter of protest to the kingdom? It seems that the situation has become even more serious than I imagined.</p>

<p>「I heard they never keep their promises at all.」</p>
<p>「Really. Maybe they'll send another person to me?」</p>
<p>「Maybe…… I heard that some of them were so persistent that the adventurer struck them. They are nobles, so it seems that the guild and the lord couldn't protect them.」</p>
<p>「Even though it's their fault?」</p>
<p>「Well, it's not a crime to solicit, and the other party is a nobleman……」</p>

<p>In the end, it seems that the person who hit first is considered to be at fault. Is that perhaps the goal? To disqualify a promising contestant by provoking him to commit a crime? Or maybe to use that as fuel for blackmail?</p>

<p>「Fran-oneesama, please be careful.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<br>

<p>That was the exchange.</p>

<p>『Let's just keep going. And when Viscount Emmert comes this way, we'll make a run for it.』</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>『Well, as long as you hide her presence, I don't think he'll find us.』</p>

<p>We blend into the crowd and pass by Viscount Emmert and a man who looks like his retainer, as the spectators enter the stadium.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Viscount Emmert and his follower did not notice Fran when she hid herself.</p>

<p>「Is that black cat girl still not here?」</p>
<p>「I think she should be here now……」</p>
<p>「Whatever! Look harder!」</p>

<p>So they really are after Fran, huh? Well, I guess we'll just have to keep staying away like this. We'll be leaving this town in a few days anyways.</p>

<p>Half an hour later.</p>

<p>『Here she is again for the first game of the day! The strongest of the black cats, Black Lightning Princess Fraaaan!』</p>

<p>No one in particular bothered us the waiting room, and we are on the arena facing today's opponent.</p>

<p>A huge shieldman in matted metal armor with a huge tower shield, Biscot, a man suspected of being a spy for the kingdom of Raydoss.</p>

<p>As I saw the first round, he is a very strong defensive type.</p>

<p>『Fran, what do you want to do today?』</p>
<p>（…I want to go alone.）</p>
<p>『Got it.』</p>
<p>（Really?）</p>
<p>『What do you mean?』</p>
<p>（Because of how Mordred bested me.）</p>
<p>『Maybe in a real battle, where lives are at stake, but this is just a competition. Besides, don't you want to fight a shieldman?』</p>
<p>（Nn.）</p>

<p>Fran has never fought a high-level shieldman in a single combat before. She wants to experience it.</p>

<p>That's why she wants to experience a fight with back and forth instead of instantly taking him down with all her might.</p>

<p>『But be careful.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>

<p>For my part, I think it's a good experience for her to take on Biscot here. Also, it was not a bad idea to save our cards for the next round.</p>

<p>「Hey, long time since we met in the dungeon.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Show me how strong you are, adventurer.」</p>
<p>「You show me that your shield isn't just a decoration.」</p>

<p>Fran and Biscot begin their match, as the two exchange killing intent.</p>

<p>「Haaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Tch!」</p>

<p>The awakened Fran cuts at full speed right from the start. It seems that even Biscot can't handle the speed.</p>

<p>She slipped through the shield and landed several good shots. The metal armor is a very good one, but it is not strong enough to completely repel our attacks.</p>

<p>Is he a disappointment? I thought so, but Biscot began to prove his toughness from this point on.</p>

<p>「Huh!」</p>
<p>「It's too weak! Far too weak!」</p>

<p>No matter how deep the blow was dealt, he was not intimidated at all. He is obviously losing a lot of blood, but he shows no sign of healing himself. He seems to have some sort of auto-regeneration skill.</p>

<p>Not damage nullification skills like Sibylla's, but just plain sturdiness and persistence. He frowns from time to time, showing that he doesn't have pain nullification. But only a little.</p>

<p>「Usually, I'm dealing with huge magical beasts! This kind of wound is an everyday occurrence!」</p>

<p>So he's gone head-to-head with large magical beasts? That would explain how tough he is.</p>

<p>Fran is currently unharmed, but it doesn't feel like we're ahead. It is probably because Biscot is not showing signs of weakness.</p>

<p>「It was a lot worse when I got chewed up and swallowed by that earth dragon!」</p>
<p>「Earth dragon?」</p>
<p>「Yeah! Our knight div… Uh, it's nothing. Anyway, we're about to get down to business! You better get serious!」</p>
<p>「Bring it!」</p>

<p>Biscot, you were gonna say "our knight division", right? Like I suspected, they are confirmed to be knights from Raydoss.</p>
