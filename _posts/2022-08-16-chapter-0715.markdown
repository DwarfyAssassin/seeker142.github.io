<h2 id="ch715">715: Neidhart and Elsa</h2>
<p>Hilt and Fran's gazes collide.</p>

<p>Even though they are far away from each other, they can feel each other's fighting spirit. Hilt does not smile and leaves without a second glance.</p>

<p>「……Fun.」</p>
<p>『But first, you have someone you have to beat, right?』</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>

<p>We don't even know if Hilt will make it to the finals in the first place. It's still only the quarterfinals next.</p>

<p>『Next up, Klikka versus Babaros.』</p>

<p>I've never heard of either of them. Klikka was a mercenary. Babaros was an adventurer.</p>

<p>When the match started, Fran raised her voice in surprise, which was rare.</p>

<p>「Huh, she can see that?」</p>
<p>『Probably. Is it the effect of her perception skills or……?』</p>

<p>The woman, Klikka, uses a mysterious fighting technique. She is a specialist in detection, or should I say sensing?</p>

<p>She perfectly dodges her opponent's attacks and hits him in the vital points with her bow and rapier. That's how it looks like.</p>

<p>Babaros, in contrast to the harshness of his name, was in fact a thin magic warrior. He had a lot of moves and his combination of wind magic and short spear was quite skillful.</p>

<p>Fran would have been able to evade him. However, it was bizarre that Klikka, who was not close to Fran's physical abilities, was able to evade all the attacks.</p>

<p>The audience may think that she is just fast, but it's more like she has eyes behind her back. Her ability to predict moves was also amazing. She would not have been able to move like that if she did not have perfect knowledge of her surroundings.</p>

<p>She did not take a single hit the entire fight.</p>

<p>For a scout, that's a hell of an ability.</p>

<p>And we were not only interested in her because of her interesting combat style.</p>

<p>（I'd expect that from Sibylla's friends.）</p>
<p>『Yeah. Urushi, are you sure it's her?』</p>
<p>（Woof!）</p>

<p>Urushi had told me that Klikka was one of Sibylla's comrades.</p>

<p>At Sibylla's and Klikka's level, it is likely that they are aware that they are being watched. They must already know that their identities are exposed, right?</p>

<p>Still, they act publicly because they don't want to reveal that awareness? If so, they may have already made plans to escape……</p>

<p>『Well, I'm sure the law enforcement will take them into custody.』</p>

<p>How could Diaz not already be aware of what I knew? I don't want to stick our noses in and interfere with the guild's operations.</p>

<p>『Looking at it this way, the knights of the Kingdom of Raydoss are probably very specialized…』</p>
<p>（I see.）</p>

<p>Biscot specializes in tanking, Klikka in scouting, and Sibylla in destruction… well, Sibylla is good at defense too, but she seems to be better at offense.</p>

<p>Though there are many flaws in them as individuals, they should be very reliable when considered as a party or a unit.</p>

<p>In this sense, their true value may lie not in duels but in group battles.</p>

<p>「Neidhart is here.」</p>
<p>『And Elsa.』</p>

<p>Next up is a battle of acquaintances.</p>

<p>Neidhart, the mantis, and Elsa, the beauty queen.</p>

<p>Elsa offers his hand, and Neidhart shakes it without hesitation. A handshake before a match is rare in this martial arts tournament. It is probably because Elsa is people person and Neidhart seems to just be a nice guy.</p>

<p>「Oh my! You're quite a hunk!」</p>
<p>「……?」</p>
<p>「What's wrong?」</p>
<p>「Nothing, I'm just a little surprised, since that didn't seem to be a mere pleasantry.」</p>
<p>「Ufufu… You have just a cool voice. I wish I could give you a loving hug.」</p>
<p>「Ha… Haha. Please be gentle.」</p>

<p>Neidhart, who is supposed to be an experienced fighter, is already at a loss before the match. That's Elsa for you.</p>

<p>Moreover, Elsa calls the mantis-headed Neidhart a hunk. Isn't his strike zone a bit too wide?</p>

<p>I'm not discriminating against bugs, but there's a limit, don't you think?</p>

<p>After the strangely long handshake before the match, the fight finally begins.</p>

<p>「Let's go!」</p>

<p>Elsa is armed with a mace and Neidhart with twin swords.</p>

<p>Elsa is not only sturdy, but also has a propensity to enjoy pain. He even possesses a skill in this area. I was expecting to see how Neidhart would ovecome that but…</p>

<p>「Oorgh! Spiral thrust!」</p>
<p>「Ehh…」</p>

<p>Immediately after the match started. It took only a single blow.</p>

<p>Neidhart's sword, which had closed the distance in an instant, pierced through Elsa's stomach, and a large amount of blood spurted out from his back.</p>

<p>「Aha…… You, put a big one in me……」</p>

<p>What's with your eyes tearing up and tone of voice?! Soon after, Elsa collapsed and was no longer moving.</p>

<p>「Did you see it?」</p>
<p>『Barely. If I had been in Elsa's place, I might have gotten hit too.』</p>
<p>「Nn……」</p>

<p>Maybe Neidhart had done some research on Elsa's fighting methods and capabilities beforehand. As a result, he chose to throw an attack at max power. Well, it seems he was lacking information on Elsa's personality though.</p>

<p>『I think it was the effect of his unique skill, Skanda, but he was scary fast……』</p>

<p>He may even exceed Fran's speed in Brilliant Lightning Rush. It was that fast. Not even Elsa's defenses could not prevent the super-speed thrust combined with strength of an insect-kin focused all on a single point.</p>

<p>Elsa stood up after being healed and approached Neidhart, but he briskly walked off stage, showing not the slightest presence of his immense power.</p>

<p>However, he is undoubtedly one of the best fighters in this year's tournament.</p>

<p>（……I'd like to fight him.）</p>
<p>『I thought you would say that, but we'll see what happens.』</p>

<p>Hilt is on the other side of the block, and there is still another match today.</p>

<p>Neidhart, who just won, will fight whoever wins the last match today. And just as we predicted, Felmus won the last match perfectly.</p>

<p>「Neidhart and Felmus!」</p>
<p>『I seriously don't know who is winning this.』</p>

<p>Fran's eyes sparkle as she thinks about the matchup between these two. She would like to fight them herself, but she is also looking forward to watching a match between the best of the best. I feel the same way, so I can understand.</p>

<p>Next comes the quarterfinals. The cradle of time, donated by the Beast King, will make its appearance. Dead contestants will be resurrected, and ring out will no longer result in a loss. In a sense, this was the beginning of the real battles.</p>

<p>『We have to beat Sibylla first to enjoy the battle between those two.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
