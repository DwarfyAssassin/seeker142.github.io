<h2 id="ch713">713: Biscot Battle Ends</h2>

<p>Fran raises her gear and attacks Biscot with the intention of deciding the match. Although she has not used Brilliant Lightning Rush yet, she has achieved a tremendous speed by using Awakening, Body Manipulation, and various magics.</p>

<p>She was able to move this fast without using any of our self-harming trump cards.</p>

<p>However, Biscot was beginning to react to Fran's attacks, even though she was much faster than before.</p>

<p>「Guard shift!」</p>
<p>「Ghm!」</p>
 
<p>He only uses his shield to block the attacks that Fran aimed at vitals, and took all the feint attacks upon his body. Biscot also withstood the lightning magic that Fran unleashed after disengaging. He does not seem to be paralyzed.</p>

<p>「Take this swing!」</p>
<p>「Too slow!」</p>
<p>「No, you're just too fast! Next time I'll hit you!」</p>
<p>「You can't!」</p>
<p>「Don't know until I try! Come on, bring it!」</p>

<p>The frequency and quantity of damage dealt by Fran has increased greatly, but Biscot's vigor is the same as it was when we started.</p>

<p>He throws sharp counters with a speed that does not match his huge body.</p>

<p>Sibylla and Biscot are too tough. They also have the same great fighting instincts. Are all warriors of the Raydoss Kingdom like them?</p>

<p>He's totally different in type, but probably similar to Mordred and Colbert in overall strength. In some areas, he would even be more troublesome than Mordred and Colbert.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Fran still had the advantage. After all, Biscot's attacks had not yet hit Fran.</p>

<p>He has a high level of shield skills and a toughness that is almost inhuman. He inspires himself and his comrades with his strong personality. Those traits probably make him perfect as a tank against magical beasts.</p>

<p>Compared to such a defensive prowess, his offensive was a few notches below. No, but I have to say he is still quite powerful and skilled.</p>

<p>If he was up against a magic beast, there should be no problem. He will catch the attack with his perfect defense and deal damage with counterattacks. Powerful mace blows delivered with his high strength will inflict damage no matter what the opponent is.</p>

<p>Biscot's strong counters are a threat even against human opponents. Even Fran can't avoid them unless she puts her mind to it.</p>

<p>But it stops there in the end.</p>

<p>There are magic beasts that move faster than Fran. But there is no such thing as a magic beast that match Fran at speed, skill, and strategy.</p>

<p>I'm sure Biscot has never fought one either. No matter how perfectly he timed his counters, he could not hit Fran.</p>

<p>「Tch! There!」</p>
<p>「No.」</p>
<p>「You're mine!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>

<p>He gets so close to hitting her, barely missing. But as time passes on, Fran is forced to parry more and more swings with her weapon. Her evasions are not fast enough.</p>

<p>Biscot must have thought it was time to go on the offensive.</p>

<p>「Spiral Bash!」</p>

<p>He unleashes an attack with his shield, which he had been hiding up until now. Normally, it would be difficult to respond to this. An extremely fast and completely unknown attack. That was his strategy.</p>

<p>Biscot's full power attack landed a direct hit… or not.</p>

<p>「What?!」</p>
<p>「I've seen that before.」</p>

<p>Fran had been on the lookout for shield attacks from the very beginning. Her history in fighting dullahans and other fiends that used shield attacks had given her this experience.</p>

<p>In addition, she had fought with Zephyld of the Heavenly Wall, a rank A adventurer who used a shield, at the royal capital.</p>

<p>Ironically, Biscot's shield art was exactly the same as Zephyld's. For a technique that Fran has seen before, it would have been even easier for her to avoid it.</p>

<p>「You got me good!」</p>
<p>「Hehe.」</p>

<p>Biscot finally realized that he had fallen into Fran's trap.</p>

<p>Fran was parrying his attacks on purpose to provoke Biscot into using a big move, making him think that she was being pushed into a corner.</p>

<p>Frankly speaking, I doubted if it would work. If it had been Mordred or Colbert, they would have seen through her trick.</p>

<p>But Biscot could not. For better or worse, Biscot is specialized in anti-magic beasts. That gave him a disadvantage in this case.</p>

<p>「You're open.」</p>
<p>「Bring it!」</p>

<p>Biscot's shield blow attack, Spiral Bash, is completely avoided, and he lost his balance. That he is still calm must be a sign of his confidence in his defense.</p>

<p>Fran would use her strongest technique, Biscot would endure it and then deliver a counter attack. That's the scenario he had in mine. I, too, thought that she would use Brilliant Lightning Rush followed by a Heavenly Judgment or Sheaths of Wind. But I was wrong.</p>

<p>Fran smirks at Biscot. She made a choice, and it was not full power attack Biscot had been expecting.</p>

<p>「Haaaah! …Just kidding.」</p>
<p>「Whoa, huh? Oh, my feet are……!」</p>

<p>Fran's land magic transformed the entire stage into a huge downward slope from Fran to Biscot. Then she threw in some ice magic on top to freeze the ground under Biscot.</p>

<p>The sudden change was terrible for Biscot, who had been bracing himself for an attack.</p>

<p>Then Fran ran straight towards him. She accelerated rapidly with a release of magic power and delivered an overhead strike.</p>

<p>Biscot managed to catch Fran's attack with his shield, but Fran was playing him like a fiddle.</p>

<p>「Damn it all!」</p>
<p>「Bye bye.」</p>

<p>Pushed by Fran, he slides all the way down the icy slope. A series of wind magic blasts were thrown as insurance, and there was nothing more he could do.</p>

<p>『I-It's decided! What a abrupt end! I never imagined such a conclusion coming from her! Black Lightning Princess Fran wins in a battle of wits!』</p>

<p>Even I didn't think Fran would choose this way, and Biscot even less so.</p>

<p>『Fran, I'm amazed you came up with that idea.』</p>
<p>（I've been wanting to try some of these things too.）</p>

<p>Apparently, she wanted to imitate Mordred and try out a method of fighting using tricky techniques. Well, it's always good to have a choice other than brute force.</p>

<p>As a result, Fran's victory was nearly flawless. She didn't spend any of her cards, and barely exhausted herself. Biscot was just simply outmatched.</p>
